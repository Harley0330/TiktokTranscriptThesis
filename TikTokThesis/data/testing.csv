In the Eagles 31-17  win over the Dolphins on Sunday night, the Dolphins were penalized 10 times while the Eagles were not called for one single penalty despite there being a massive collection of videos in which they clearly committed blatant game-changing fouls. These clips have now went viral on Twitter and fans are calling for an investigation as they've also discovered that Dwayne Hayde, one of the lead refs from the game,
has a history of unfair refereeing, specifically in games that involve teams from Pennsylvania where he grew up.  In 2017, Hayden  and his crew were suspended from refing an ACC Championship game due to previous unethical refereeing during a game in which Pittsburgh,  a Pennsylvania team just like the Eagles,  played Clemson and received major help from the refs as Hayden's crew called Clemson for a season-high 10 penalties
let many calls slide for Pittsburgh.  Last night's Dolphins-Eagles game was only the second time in NFL history that one team finished with 0 penalties and the other team finished with 10 plus penalties.  Here you can see one of the worst missed calls of the game, where Eagles cornerback James Bradbury pulls receiver Cedric Wilson to the ground by his face mask right in front of the ref and he ignores it.  Or this one, where linebacker David Long is literally grabbed by the neck and pulled to the ground by an offensive
To add to the conspiracy,  fans have also pointed out that prior to this Sunday night game,  Vegas had had a tough day and really needed to come out on the winning side of the last game of the day where most of the money was on the Dolphins.  Do you guys think this was just bunch of piled up coincidences, or was this game really fixed for the Eagles to win?

You mean the the the outcome the point spread What I'm saying the points were shaved and thereby fixed. How does this happen? Well, I first got into this about 1983 Vincent Persani who is the head of the Michigan State Attorney General's Office organized crime division told me if you're gonna do a book about the NFL Dan you're gonna have to get into this guy Don Dawson because he was fixing games We knew it. I went to my friends and my sources at the Internal Revenue Service the organized crime intelligence division They said Don Dawson was fixing games I went to the FBI the organized crime and racketeering section of the Justice Department and strike force field offices Everybody told me what Don Dawson was fixing games At that point I had enough evidence to print that allegedly Don Dawson was fixing NFL games He was a major bookmaker in the Midwest. I then went to Dawson. I tracked him down I would jump through all kinds of hoops to interview him and when I interviewed him on about the seventh or eighth interview He admitted to me that he had personally Participate in the fixing of no fewer than 32 NFL games. How and how does that happen? He liked to work with a quarterback. He would he would he would go to the quarterback would come to him and say I need some bread What's the line on the game this week and the and the bookmaker would say you guys are favored by six points And then the reply was we're not gonna cover the spread and basically that was it Now do you do name players? Oh sure I named players and also in 1979 I name I go into the specifics of eight fixed games that were allegedly fixed by two referees who were Investigated by both the FBI and the IRS and I named I list the eight games in the on page 308 of the book.
