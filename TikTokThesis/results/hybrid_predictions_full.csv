In the Eagles 31-17  win over the Dolphins on Sunday night, the Dolphins were penalized 10 times while the Eagles were not called for one single penalty despite there being a massive collection of videos in which they clearly committed blatant game-changing fouls. These clips have now went viral on Twitter and fans are calling for an investigation as they've also discovered that Dwayne Hayde, one of the lead refs from the game,
has a history of unfair refereeing, specifically in games that involve teams from Pennsylvania where he grew up.  In 2017, Hayden  and his crew were suspended from refing an ACC Championship game due to previous unethical refereeing during a game in which Pittsburgh,  a Pennsylvania team just like the Eagles,  played Clemson and received major help from the refs as Hayden's crew called Clemson for a season-high 10 penalties
let many calls slide for Pittsburgh.  Last night's Dolphins-Eagles game was only the second time in NFL history that one team finished with 0 penalties and the other team finished with 10 plus penalties.  Here you can see one of the worst missed calls of the game, where Eagles cornerback James Bradbury pulls receiver Cedric Wilson to the ground by his face mask right in front of the ref and he ignores it.  Or this one, where linebacker David Long is literally grabbed by the neck and pulled to the ground by an offensive
To add to the conspiracy,  fans have also pointed out that prior to this Sunday night game,  Vegas had had a tough day and really needed to come out on the winning side of the last game of the day where most of the money was on the Dolphins.  Do you guys think this was just bunch of piled up coincidences, or was this game really fixed for the Eagles to win?

You mean the the the outcome the point spread What I'm saying the points were shaved and thereby fixed. How does this happen? Well, I first got into this about 1983 Vincent Persani who is the head of the Michigan State Attorney General's Office organized crime division told me if you're gonna do a book about the NFL Dan you're gonna have to get into this guy Don Dawson because he was fixing games We knew it. I went to my friends and my sources at the Internal Revenue Service the organized crime intelligence division They said Don Dawson was fixing games I went to the FBI the organized crime and racketeering section of the Justice Department and strike force field offices Everybody told me what Don Dawson was fixing games At that point I had enough evidence to print that allegedly Don Dawson was fixing NFL games He was a major bookmaker in the Midwest. I then went to Dawson. I tracked him down I would jump through all kinds of hoops to interview him and when I interviewed him on about the seventh or eighth interview He admitted to me that he had personally Participate in the fixing of no fewer than 32 NFL games. How and how does that happen? He liked to work with a quarterback. He would he would he would go to the quarterback would come to him and say I need some bread What's the line on the game this week and the and the bookmaker would say you guys are favored by six points And then the reply was we're not gonna cover the spread and basically that was it Now do you do name players? Oh sure I named players and also in 1979 I name I go into the specifics of eight fixed games that were allegedly fixed by two referees who were Investigated by both the FBI and the IRS and I named I list the eight games in the on page 308 of the book.

ABC's Morgan Norwood joins us with more details. Morgan, good morning. Well, good morning. Witnesses say Jermel English was headed to the bathroom to change his baby's diaper when police wrestled him to the ground with his wailing child in his arms. By the way, the problem is, though cops had the wrong guy. Is still facing charges. Get the baby. Get the baby.  Get the baby. Get the baby. When police stormed this Applebee's in Kenosha, Wisconsin, they thought they were arresting a hit and run suspect. I Please look. Get the baby. Little did they know he was just a dad having dinner with his family. Jermel English Jr. Tackled to the ground by officers as his baby was clinging to a shirt. This now viral video part of an internal investigation by Kenosha police. Somebody b watch as frantic employees grab the child just seconds before an officer allegedly pummel English with punches as another handcuffs him. It was just sad. I just felt bad for the baby. Jennifer Harris was the manager on duty that night. She says she held the baby while police were detaining the father. Harris says she was terminated because employees recorded the incident. Applebee's fired me after 11 years. They said I made aflebees look bad. Harris also says the officers used pepper spray at one point. Kenosha police confirm it was deployed, but say the child was not in the immediate area when pepper spray was used, so wasn't directly exposed. It's hard to say if the child was affected due to any particulates in the air. Kenosha police say they were initially called to the Applebee's to investigate a nearby rollover crash where the suspects involved took off. A say staff told them two black men and a woman matching the suspect's description ran inside the restaurant. One, according to police, carrying a child. The female running. She has a baby with her. But Jermel English, who during the confrontation insisted he did nothing wrong. I'm not turned out not to be the suspect in that hit and run. The actual suspects hiding in the bathroom and now facing charges. And though police initially had the wrong suspect here, Jamel English was still charged with resisting arrests and disorderly conduct. Kenosha police say their internal investigation will determine whether the officers acted appropriately and if they'll face any disciplinary action. Jan.

So I didn't know when the light would turn in order to cross safely with my child. I just thought intuitively that that was a major problem. So that's when I started thinking about pedestrian safety and how we can do better for especially our most vulnerable populations.

It’s illegal to begin crossing if the countdown timer has started in cities like Toronto are starting to enforce this rule at some intersections in order to speed up car traffic. This means that if you’re not waiting in the intersection at just the right time to cross you missed your chance and have to wait another light cycle. Crossing distances can be very very long in North America as well meaning that there’s a very long time that a person walking is vulnerable in the intersection. This is particularly bad in many parts of the American South like here in Las Vegas because these places are designed almost exclusively to move as many cars as possible not for the benefit of people outside of cars. Las Vegas is a horrible place to walk, but lots of people need to do it, and these people are left dealing with whatever scraps are left over after traffic engineers are done, designing exclusively for cars. And even traffic signals, there are times when pedestrian crossings aren’t allowed in order to speed up car traffic it’s very telling that North American cities will spend millions of dollars on projects designed to speed up a driver's commute by a few minutes but routinely make road changes that add to the time it takes to walk somewhere. This is also why you’ll see another common problem crossing the street in the US and Canada there are often very long distances between crossings because too many stoplights will slow down car traffic. For example, how are you supposed to get to this bus stop? and when you get off the bus in suburban places in America it’s a long walk to the nearest intersection. And finally there are lanes like this one that allow drivers to turn right without a signal and without slowing down, these are extremely dangerous for people outside of cars and should never be used where people are expected to cross. They really highlight that North American traffic engineers value the convenience of people who drive more than the lives of the people who walk. In a few cities these are being removed to increase safety. There used to be one here on this corner, but it was filled in with a small stormwater management garden a few years ago, now drivers need to make a much slower and safer sharp turn here.”","['video', 'shows', 'road', 'streets', 'city', 'man', 'saying', 'typical', 'american', 'walk', 'signal', 'come', 'seconds', 'turn', 'flashing', 'hand', 'countdown', 'timer', 'showing', 'much', 'time', 'left', 'across', 'street', 'illegal', 'begin', 'crossing', 'countdown', 'timer', 'started', 'cities', 'like', 'toronto', 'starting', 'enforce', 'rule', 'intersections', 'order', 'speed', 'car', 'traffic', 'means', 'youre', 'waiting', 'intersection', 'right', 'time', 'cross', 'missed', 'chance', 'wait', 'another', 'light', 'cycle', 'crossing', 'distances', 'long', 'north', 'america', 'well', 'meaning', 'theres', 'long', 'time', 'person', 'walking', 'vulnerable', 'intersection', 'particularly', 'bad', 'many', 'parts', 'american', 'south', 'like', 'las', 'vegas', 'places', 'designed', 'almost', 'exclusively', 'move', 'many', 'cars', 'possible', 'benefit', 'people', 'outside', 'cars', 'las', 'vegas', 'horrible', 'place', 'walk', 'lots', 'people', 'need', 'people', 'left', 'dealing', 'whatever', 'scraps', 'left', 'traffic', 'engineers', 'done', 'designing', 'exclusively', 'cars', 'even', 'traffic', 'signals', 'times', 'pedestrian', 'crossings', 'arent', 'allowed', 'order', 'speed', 'car', 'traffic', 'telling', 'north', 'american', 'cities', 'spend', 'millions', 'dollars', 'projects', 'designed', 'speed', 'drivers', 'commute', 'minutes', 'routinely', 'make', 'road', 'changes', 'add', 'time', 'takes', 'walk', 'somewhere', 'also', 'youll', 'see', 'another', 'common', 'problem', 'crossing', 'street', 'us', 'canada', 'often', 'long', 'distances', 'crossings', 'many', 'stoplights', 'slow', 'car', 'traffic', 'example', 'supposed', 'get', 'bus', 'stop', 'get', 'bus', 'suburban', 'places', 'america', 'long', 'walk', 'nearest', 'intersection', 'finally', 'lanes', 'like', 'one', 'allow', 'drivers', 'turn', 'right', 'without', 'signal', 'without', 'slowing', 'extremely', 'dangerous', 'people', 'outside', 'cars', 'never', 'used', 'people', 'expected', 'cross', 'really', 'highlight', 'north', 'american', 'traffic', 'engineers', 'value', 'convenience', 'people', 'drive', 'lives', 'people', 'walk', 'cities', 'removed', 'increase', 'safety', 'used', 'one', 'corner', 'filled', 'small', 'stormwater', 'management', 'garden', 'years', 'ago', 'drivers', 'need', 'make', 'much', 'slower', 'safer', 'sharp', 'turn']",0,real,0.38882754922988566

Experiences from other cities worldwide have shown that reimagining streets in this way can lead to healthier lifestyles, reduced pollution, and stronger community ties.

It focuses on traffic entering the city, mainly from Entebbe along the old Kampala-Entebbe Road and from Mpigi along the Kampala-Mpigi Expressway. Construction: The project involves constructing flyovers at the “Clock Tower” and “Kitgum House,” widening Nsambya Road and Mukwano Road, and improving interfacing roads and junctions. The project stretches over approximately 3.5 kilometers (2 miles). Funding: The Ugandan government, with financing from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), funds the project. Progress: Despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak, construction is progressing steadily. Excavation works on the 4-lane underpass are nearing completion, and screw piles for the flyover and pedestrian bridges have been delivered on-site12.

And so, with children, elderly people, everyone together, like, mixed together, and there was a lot of smoke. So, unfortunately, vaping is widespread, and the more people use it, I think the harder it will be for us to take action against this crap vape. Here, they even have something that looks like a super vape, which is a vape that releases a lot of smoke. You know, I think it's much stronger than what we see in Brazil.

Cecilia Gentili, an Argentina-born artist and activist known for her work in the immigrant and transgender rights movements in New York City, is being widely remembered following her death last week. She was 52. As an actress, Gentili stood out with her memorable portrayal of Ms. Orlando on the groundbreaking series Pose, which illuminated the experiences of trans women of colour during the AIDS crisis of the 1980s. News of her death broke on Tuesday (February 6), when close friends and family took to her Instagram page to announce her passing, saying: “Our beloved Cecilia Gentili passed away this morning to continue watching over us in spirit. Please be gentle with each other and love one another with ferocity.” Gentili was seen by many as a symbol of hope and resilience. Her journey from Argentina to the bustling streets of New York City was marked by her continuing unwavering advocacy for marginalised communities, from undocumented immigrants to sex workers. She took pivotal roles at prominent organisations like New York City–based AIDS non-profit GMHC and founded Trans Equity Consulting, where her mission was to amplify the voices of marginalised communities. Her activism also took the form of initiatives like Transmissions Fest, a music festival aimed at putting transgender voices centre stage, and fundraising event Fierce Futures in support of Black trans people. Tributes to Cecilia poured in across social media from a range of people from all walks of life. American writer and book editor Raquel Willis said: “Cecilia Gentili was a living legend. A titan, an unapologetic example of trans joy and power. Her spirit lives on in all whom she touched and all she built for us. Rest powerfully and peacefully, Mami. And go kiki with the ancestors. You deserve eternal pleasure.” All of the tributes made one thing very clear: that Cecilia Gentili’s impact had transcended boundaries and will linger for decades to come. #ceciliagentili #trans #lgbt #aoc #uspolitics ",real,1.0,"Serving you LGBTQ+ content to inform, inspire and empower",2024-02-16 13:00:44,AOC is an actress,"I rise today to reflect on the life and legacy of beloved Queens community leaders Cecilia Gentili. Cecilia was a beacon of hope for so many communities in my district. She was only 26 when she fled Argentina to seek asylum in the United States. She arrived in New York City in 2003 and lived her truth as a trans woman. She was finally granted asylum in 2012 as well, and she devoted much of her life to uplifting our trans and undocumented community in Queens. Most recently Cecilia shined in her artistic pursuits as an author, playwright, and actress. Cecilia was a leader in the fight for HIV AIDS healthcare and founded a free healthcare clinic in New York City. At the state level she championed the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, GENDA, which was signed into law into 2019. And today Cecilia would have also wanted to continue to uplift her advocacy against the dangers of proposals like COSA, and would allow states to cut off access to life-saving online resources for online trans youth like healthcare information.

As the proud representative for San Francisco in Congress, it is my privilege to share some exciting news. A landmark new federal investment of $200 million is headed to the Presidio. For decades, the Presidio has offered Bay Area families a place to enjoy the beauty of the Golden Gate, to walk the grounds, to interpret nature, to honor our heritage, and now to enjoy the Tunnel Tops recreation area. When it was established, the Presidio received a huge federal financial commitment to turn from Army post to urban part. But over time, the Presidio has faced critical deferred maintenance needs for utilities, preventing the part from reaching its fulfillment. With this funding, we ensure that our spectacular front window to the Bay is sustained for years to come. Today marks another monumental step toward that mission, ensuring that the Presidio of San Francisco remains free and open for the people.","['good', 'afternoon', 'proud', 'representative', 'san', 'francisco', 'congress', 'privilege', 'share', 'exciting', 'news', 'landmark', 'new', 'federal', 'investment', '200', 'million', 'headed', 'presidio', 'decades', 'presidio', 'offered', 'bay', 'area', 'families', 'place', 'enjoy', 'beauty', 'golden', 'gate', 'walk', 'grounds', 'interpret', 'nature', 'honor', 'heritage', 'enjoy', 'tunnel', 'tops', 'recreation', 'area', 'established', 'presidio', 'received', 'huge', 'federal', 'financial', 'commitment', 'turn', 'army', 'post', 'urban', 'part', 'time', 'presidio', 'faced', 'critical', 'deferred', 'maintenance', 'needs', 'utilities', 'preventing', 'part', 'reaching', 'fulfillment', 'funding', 'ensure', 'spectacular', 'front', 'window', 'bay', 'sustained', 'years', 'come', 'today', 'marks', 'another', 'monumental', 'step', 'toward', 'mission', 'ensuring', 'presidio', 'san', 'francisco', 'remains', 'free', 'open', 'people']",1,real,0.45259739590417186

The discovery of fish with an uncanny resemblance to human faces continues to ignite debate online,  fueling speculation, poaching, and heightened security measures. Locals, already wary of the influx of poachers, are now raising concerns about secretive animal research labs operating in the area. Their suspicion? These labs might be conducting unauthorized genetic experiments specifically, cloning or DNA manipulation on fish.
Some residents believe escaped lab specimens could be the source of the human-faced fish, now thriving and breeding in the lake. They allege a possible cover-up fearing environmental and ethical ramifications.  However, these claims remain unverified. Experts urge caution against misinformation, particularly through viral videos promoting unsubstantiated theories. Meanwhile, tensions boil over. Poachers, desperate for a lucrative prize, face growing resistance.
Reports of boats mysteriously set ablaze and high-security zones established around the lake with barbed wire fences and armed guards paint a picture of escalating conflict. Authorities work tirelessly to maintain order, navigating both environmental concerns and ethical questions surrounding the labs. Poachers remain undeterred, putting both the endangered fish and the fragile ecosystem at risk. As the investigation unfolds, one question remains. Are the human-faced fish a natural anomaly?
or a disturbing byproduct of scientific manipulation, only time and a thorough investigation will tell.  We'll continue to follow this developing story.

He calls this device the park car and says it can be installed on any model.  Watch how it works.  Taking power from the drive shaft, the spare tire swings the rear end into the clear. Then he just retracts the spare, backs into the street,  and away we go.
It's handy for parking in inaccessible garages, too.  Here's a narrow driveway, but with the spare tire put to work, the car can turn a complete circle in its own radius. And parking is simple indeed.  Even the worst driver can make the garage without denting a fender with the aid of fifth wheel driving.

This is something that I've been warning you about for a while now, and it's about to get serious. We are about to see some serious stuff hit the fan. If you're in the 1%, then you're probably going to be fine. You're about to probably make a lot more money. But if you're like me, then you should be very worried about what's coming, guys. I think people are missing a major piece of this, the China part of this development, which we now have our clearest sign yet that the United States dollar is in real trouble. We're going to show you what China has been doing that has me very worried.
And what the United States is lying about, quite frankly,  oh, rates are coming down?  Nothing to worry about. Oh, really? Get ready, because this data is frightening or really exciting, like I said, if you're in the 1 % because you're about to get a lot richer. But most people will not. Most people will get hurt really hard. So we'll get to that in a second. But first, I want to be very clear. The US dollar is not going to collapse overnight. Large structures don't just suddenly collapse. Cracks and fissures, along with a controlled demolition, bring down large structures.
metaphor, the large structure is the US economy. And make no mistake about it, a controlled demolition

But the big news is that China is dumping US treasuries like a bad habit. On pace to unload most, if not all of them by the end of fiscal year 2024. And they're ramping up massive stimulus because the economy is crapping the bed right now.  We just got the November numbers, which are the latest numbers of the US treasuries, and they took a huge dump. Many more countries have been selling billions of dollars worth of US treasuries. China's US treasury holdings fell to just under 800 billion.
That's a huge decline. It's the lowest in 20 years. And as we've shown you here on the show, China has been selling off U.S. treasuries for over 10 years. But what's stunning in this new data is that Beijing just sold off 15 percent of its entire holdings of U.S. treasuries. If they sold them all at once, it would destroy the United States. And Congress knows it. They've been running tabletop exercises on it. And then when they asked Janet Yellen about, hey, what's your contingency plan over at the Treasury Department? This was her response.
The scenario was that China, the second largest foreign creditor of US treasuries,  would dump  that $859 billion in treasury securities.  How are you working with our allies internationally and also the Federal Reserve  to deal with a situation where China would dump  that volume of treasury securities overnight? So  we are  not engaging in specific  exercises to
address such a risk,  but the United States,  the National Security Council  is certainly concerned  on an ongoing basis. Madam Secretary, I would encourage Treasury to  make preparations and  be on the ready. Do you feel better now? Great response. Meanwhile, China is dumping US dollars and buying up as much gold as they can possibly find, a record pace of buying gold.
Remember, we use the sale of these treasuries to finance just about everything we hold dear in the United States, from Social Security to all of the wars that the United States loves to launch. This is all interrelated, folks. Saudi Arabia, the BRICS nations, dumping tens of billions of dollars of U.S. treasuries. But it gets worse, much worse. And I think this is really the most important part of the story because we can't control China. And now it looks like we can't control our own banks here at home because things are about to get crazy. The dollar is about to go insane.
when the yield curve starts rising again. Experts believe things are going to go insane right around March  11th. That's when the reverse repo market runs out. The bank term funds program

Look at what is going on in the world. Even the United States allies are now downsizing their dollar reserves. Seeing this, everyone starts looking for ways to protect themselves. I think it is complete foolishness from the point of view of the interests of the United States itself and its taxpayers, as it damages the US economy, undermines the power of the United States across the world. Do you even realize what is going on or not? does anyone in the united states realize this what are you doing you're cutting yourself off all experts say this before i show you this new data out of china i want you to understand something about the u.s treasuries as my grandma used to say u.s treasuries are the one you know safest investment in the world they're issued by the us government and they're backed by the full faith and credit of the u.s government so you know you should invest in them right Well, as of this video, the amount of U.S. Treasury's outstanding is less than 26 trillion. First off, of U.S. Treasury's outstanding is less than 26 trillion. In the fall, that number was over 30 trillion. Where did that 4 trillion go? The answer is they dumped it. They got rid of it. The biggest foreign holders of these Treasury bills, Japan, China, Saudi Arabia, the UK, they're selling them off. Normally, with these treasuries, they give the United States money and they expect to be paid back with interest. So the United States gets this money from China and then sends it off to Ukraine and other places. As Senator Rand Paul said, this is madness. But it's irresponsible to simply borrow more money. To borrow the money from China, simply to send it to Ukraine makes no sense and makes us weaker, not stronger.","['make', 'mistake', 'controlled', 'demolition', 'thats', 'youre', 'watching', 'right', 'us', 'dollar', 'cease', 'exist', 'know', 'become', 'digital', 'dollar', 'controlled', 'wall', 'street', 'instead', 'us', 'treasury', 'happening', 'whether', 'like', 'ship', 'sailed', 'actually', 'much', 'along', 'americans', 'even', 'know', 'thats', 'happening', 'putin', 'said', 'last', 'week', 'interview', 'tucker', 'carlson', 'us', 'destroying', 'dollar', 'hands', 'said', 'hes', 'spoton', 'correct', 'look', 'going', 'world', 'even', 'united', 'states', 'allies', 'downsizing', 'dollar', 'reserves', 'seeing', 'everyone', 'starts', 'looking', 'ways', 'protect', 'think', 'complete', 'foolishness', 'point', 'view', 'interests', 'united', 'states', 'taxpayers', 'damages', 'us', 'economy', 'undermines', 'power', 'united', 'states', 'across', 'world', 'even', 'realize', 'going', 'anyone', 'united', 'states', 'realize', 'youre', 'cutting', 'experts', 'say', 'show', 'new', 'data', 'china', 'want', 'understand', 'something', 'us', 'treasuries', 'grandma', 'used', 'say', 'us', 'treasuries', 'one', 'know', 'safest', 'investment', 'world', 'theyre', 'issued', 'us', 'government', 'theyre', 'backed', 'full', 'faith', 'credit', 'us', 'government', 'know', 'invest', 'right', 'well', 'video', 'amount', 'us', 'treasurys', 'outstanding', 'less', '26', 'trillion', 'first', 'us', 'treasurys', 'outstanding', 'less', '26', 'trillion', 'fall', 'number', '30', 'trillion', '4', 'trillion', 'go', 'answer', 'dumped', 'got', 'rid', 'biggest', 'foreign', 'holders', 'treasury', 'bills', 'japan', 'china', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'uk', 'theyre', 'selling', 'normally', 'treasuries', 'give', 'united', 'states', 'money', 'expect', 'paid', 'back', 'interest', 'united', 'states', 'gets', 'money', 'china', 'sends', 'ukraine', 'places', 'senator', 'rand', 'paul', 'said', 'madness', 'irresponsible', 'simply', 'borrow', 'money', 'borrow', 'money', 'china', 'simply', 'send', 'ukraine', 'makes', 'sense', 'makes', 'us', 'weaker', 'stronger']",0,real,0.4345702295133342

And a lot of people expected something like this,
but not for the amount. But this is a very dishonest man. This is a man been overturned
already on this case four times, but a crooked New York State judge just ruled that I have to pay a fine of $355 million for having built a perfect company. Great cash, great buildings, great everything. It affects New York. It's mostly talking about New York, where we have a totally corrupt attorney general. She campaigned on the fact that I will get Trump. I will get Trump. Everybody seen it. Letitia James, they've all seen it. Well, will be appealing, but more important than that, this is Russia, this is China. This is the same game. All comes out of the DOJ. It's a witch hunt against his political opponent, the likes of which our country has never seen before.
You see it in third world countries, banana republics, but you don't see it here.” And CNN reporter Daniel Dale saying “I think it's worth delving a bit further into this repeated claim that all this comes out of Biden and the DOJ, and it's Biden directed election interference. New York Attorney General James filed the lawsuit that LED to this judgment in 2019. So that is before Joe Biden even became president. She began the investigation in 2019, before Biden became president, and she filed the lawsuit that LED to this judgment in 2022. That was before Donald Trump even launched His. His campaign for the 2024 election. So not only is there no evidence,
Brianna, the. The timeline makes no sense whatsoever. Now, he repeatedly accused
judging Goron of being corrupt and crooked, a serious charge against a judge. Zero basis for that whatsoever. Rather, he is a judge who came to conclusion that Trump didn't like. Trump also claimed that Engoron ruled against him. He said before even getting the case, didn't even know what he was ruling on. Now, it is true that Engoron found Trump liable for fraud before the trial began, uh, which was a surprise to some people, but it wasn't before he got the case. Rather, he'd receive numerous written filings from both sides and came out with a detailed judgment about why he didn't have to wait for a trial to find Trump libel for fraud. So claim after claim, Brianna.

Tourists outside New Zealand were thrilled to visit the White island volcano. While touring the island, Aorru Guai was informed that the volcanic threat had been raised to a two, with three being full on eruption. But this was not relayed to the dozens of guests that were standing right outside the volcano. Shortly after this photo, the smoke coming out of the volcano started to turn black and the tour guides started screaming, run. Can you imagine how scary that would be? And other tourists and boats watched horrified as hot ash started to fly out of the volcano. Everyone who was visiting the craters started screaming and running, but they had to be incredibly fast. Debris was flying at 100 meters per second and guests described the ash clouding their vision. It's hard to watch, but Crystal's phone captures the frenzied moments and sheer terror unfolding at 11 minutes past 2 as the volcano erupts. Run. And the thing about this eruption is that this was steam, which is a liquid that has been boiled so hot that it's now air. And on top of that, a lot of the fumes were toxic. A helicopter that one tour company owned was so damaged that they couldn't fly it out.  So all 37 guests, some with very, very serious burns, had to line up on the dock to be rescued. One survivor even described looking down at his hands and the skin on his fingers was melting off. And like most cases I cover, the rescue mission for this was extremely disorganized. A local medical center had their air unit standing by, but waited to go to the island. Those who are evacuated from the island suffered life changing burns. Many required skin grafts, amputations, and even medically induced comas. And most of the photos I cannot show. In total, 14 Australians, five Americans, two New Zealanders and one German lost their lives. Many of the victims, including Stephanie above, were on a Royal Caribbean cruise and the compensation they were offered was a refunded ticket. To make matters worse, Royal Caribbean was the subject of so many lawsuits from this incident that they actually filed counteruits against the survivors, which is just one more reason not to go on a cruise. I understand wanting to go on an adventure, but please do your research because these companies will hide information from.","['photo', 'taken', 'seconds', 'disaster', 'tourists', 'outside', 'new', 'zealand', 'thrilled', 'visit', 'white', 'island', 'volcano', 'touring', 'island', 'aorru', 'guai', 'informed', 'volcanic', 'threat', 'raised', 'two', 'three', 'full', 'eruption', 'relayed', 'dozens', 'guests', 'standing', 'right', 'outside', 'volcano', 'shortly', 'photo', 'smoke', 'coming', 'volcano', 'started', 'turn', 'black', 'tour', 'guides', 'started', 'screaming', 'run', 'imagine', 'scary', 'would', 'tourists', 'boats', 'watched', 'horrified', 'hot', 'ash', 'started', 'fly', 'volcano', 'everyone', 'visiting', 'craters', 'started', 'screaming', 'running', 'incredibly', 'fast', 'debris', 'flying', '100', 'meters', 'per', 'second', 'guests', 'described', 'ash', 'clouding', 'vision', 'hard', 'watch', 'crystals', 'phone', 'captures', 'frenzied', 'moments', 'sheer', 'terror', 'unfolding', '11', 'minutes', 'past', '2', 'volcano', 'erupts', 'run', 'thing', 'eruption', 'steam', 'liquid', 'boiled', 'hot', 'air', 'top', 'lot', 'fumes', 'toxic', 'helicopter', 'one', 'tour', 'company', 'owned', 'damaged', 'couldnt', 'fly', '37', 'guests', 'serious', 'burns', 'line', 'dock', 'rescued', 'one', 'survivor', 'even', 'described', 'looking', 'hands', 'skin', 'fingers', 'melting', 'like', 'cases', 'cover', 'rescue', 'mission', 'extremely', 'disorganized', 'local', 'medical', 'center', 'air', 'unit', 'standing', 'waited', 'go', 'island', 'evacuated', 'island', 'suffered', 'life', 'changing', 'burns', 'many', 'required', 'skin', 'grafts', 'amputations', 'even', 'medically', 'induced', 'comas', 'photos', 'show', 'total', '14', 'australians', 'five', 'americans', 'two', 'new', 'zealanders', 'one', 'german', 'lost', 'lives', 'many', 'victims', 'including', 'stephanie', 'royal', 'caribbean', 'cruise', 'compensation', 'offered', 'refunded', 'ticket', 'make', 'matters', 'worse', 'royal', 'caribbean', 'subject', 'many', 'lawsuits', 'incident', 'actually', 'filed', 'counteruits', 'survivors', 'one', 'reason', 'go', 'cruise', 'understand', 'wanting', 'go', 'adventure', 'please', 'research', 'companies', 'hide', 'information']",1,real,0.48499252195070897

On December 9, 2019, the tourist destination was transformed into a disaster zone with deadly consequences. Located off the coast of New Zealand's North Island, the island drew thousands of visitors each year. When tourists entered White Island, they walked into a crater that could erupted anytime. A mounted camera captured this photo just before the explosion. Directly below their feet is a mix of magma and superheated gas. Tourists were in the crater and watching from a nearby cruise ship when the volcano moved into a full-scale eruption. New Zealand's earthquake monitoring body, GeoNet, said explosive eruptions can happen with little or no warning. They eject cannonball-like hot rocks, ash clouds and surges of boiling gases and rock projectiles into the air. 47 people on the island at the time. 22 people died, including 17 Australians. Criminal charges were brought by WorkSafe New Zealand, which alleged the three-buttle brothers as well as 10 other parties breached workplace safety laws and said the brothers didn't make sure the tours were safe. After years of waiting, the the is finally underway and is giving some families closure.","['22', 'people', 'died', 'waqari', 'white', 'island', 'volcano', 'erupted', 'three', 'brothers', 'going', 'trial', 'december', '9', '2019', 'tourist', 'destination', 'transformed', 'disaster', 'zone', 'deadly', 'consequences', 'located', 'coast', 'new', 'zealands', 'north', 'island', 'island', 'drew', 'thousands', 'visitors', 'year', 'tourists', 'entered', 'white', 'island', 'walked', 'crater', 'could', 'erupted', 'anytime', 'mounted', 'camera', 'captured', 'photo', 'explosion', 'directly', 'feet', 'mix', 'magma', 'superheated', 'gas', 'tourists', 'crater', 'watching', 'nearby', 'cruise', 'ship', 'volcano', 'moved', 'fullscale', 'eruption', 'new', 'zealands', 'earthquake', 'monitoring', 'body', 'geonet', 'said', 'explosive', 'eruptions', 'happen', 'little', 'warning', 'eject', 'cannonballlike', 'hot', 'rocks', 'ash', 'clouds', 'surges', 'boiling', 'gases', 'rock', 'projectiles', 'air', '47', 'people', 'island', 'time', '22', 'people', 'died', 'including', '17', 'australians', 'criminal', 'charges', 'brought', 'worksafe', 'new', 'zealand', 'alleged', 'threebuttle', 'brothers', 'well', '10', 'parties', 'breached', 'workplace', 'safety', 'laws', 'said', 'brothers', 'didnt', 'make', 'sure', 'tours', 'safe', 'years', 'waiting', 'finally', 'underway', 'giving', 'families', 'closure']",1,real,0.4559675612381767

Now these passengers all bought the tickets from Royal Caribbean.
through their tour operator desk or online.  And then Royal Caribbean provided some transportation to the boat,  which ended up taking them out to this island.  And there were no sufficient safety measures in place. And no one warned these passengers that this active volcano was more likely than not going to erupt.  There had been warnings issued by several geological  organizations that said  that there was a danger of having this volcano erupt, but no one told the passengers.
and they've been sued. Royal Caribbean was sued here in the United States in federal district court.  Their defense was, look, we did operate the tour. If you want to sue the tour operator, go to New Zealand and good luck. But today, a federal judge here in South Florida said, oh no, Royal Caribbean, you have a responsibility, a legal duty under the law to  provide safety to your passengers, which includes the duty to warn them of dangers that you know or should have known of. And there was an increased likelihood
that this volcano was going to erupt and you didn't tell them. You sold them the tickets, you processed the tickets, you sold them through your excursion desk or online, and therefore you're responsible. So the case was not dismissed, which is great news for the survivors and the families of victims,  that they'll be able to hold the cruise line accountable here in federal court in Florida and not have to go to New Zealand and try to hold some tour operator responsible. This is an important lesson.
Tragic story, but an important lesson if you go on a cruise, always buy your excursions through the cruise line. Don't buy them independently to save a few shekels because the cruise line will be responsible if something goes wrong. And it often does. And  you don't want to be chasing down some zipline excursion operator in Roatan, Honduras. You want to be able to hold Carnival, Royal Caribbean, or Celebrity responsible if they sold you the excursion.
Very sad news for the victims, but good news that their families are going to get their day in court. Let me know what you think, and as always, have a safe cruise.

Walgreen says this Richmond neighborhood store, with aisles of products like mustard locked behind plexiglass, has the highest theft rate of all. Their nearly 9,000 US doors hit more than a dozen times a day. When thieves turned to cleaning out ice cream and frozen burritos, workers grew so frustrated they resorted to the chains they were ordered down by corporate because of the negative messaging. San Francisco City Supervisor Matt Dorsey, former police spokesman and recovering drug addict, sees the rampant shoplifting as a systemic problem. From city leaders to an understaffed police force to the fentanyl crisis.” ,

Open Arms says the shipwreck shows the situation is increasingly critical and they've denounced the lack of humanity by EU institutions. The number attempting to reach Europe face a spike.

A series of horrifying murders targeted young African-American children, sending shockwaves through the community. Parents clutched their children tighter at night, and an air of terror permeated the city streets. As the body count rose, all eyes turned to Wayne Williams. Charismatic yet mysterious, he became the prime suspect in this gruesome string of crimes. The city demanded answers, and investigators worked tirelessly to connect the dots.The atmosphere was thick with suspicion and paranoia. The trial of Wayne Williams was a high-stakes drama that played out in the courtroom. Controversy surrounded the proceedings as the prosecution built its case, linking Williams to the Atlanta child murders. Tensions soared as the community awaited a resolution. In the end, Williams was convicted, but doubts lingered. Some questioned whether he was the true perpetrator or a convenient scapegoat. The Atlanta child murders left scars on the city, and the mystery of what truly happened continues to haunt the collective memory, an unresolved tale of suspense and tragedy.","['lost', 'history', 'atlanta', 'child', 'murders', 'late', '1970s', 'early', '1980s', 'atlanta', 'became', 'city', 'gripped', 'fear', 'series', 'horrifying', 'murders', 'targeted', 'young', 'africanamerican', 'children', 'sending', 'shockwaves', 'community', 'parents', 'clutched', 'children', 'tighter', 'night', 'air', 'terror', 'permeated', 'city', 'streets', 'body', 'count', 'rose', 'eyes', 'turned', 'wayne', 'williams', 'charismatic', 'yet', 'mysterious', 'became', 'prime', 'suspect', 'gruesome', 'string', 'crimes', 'city', 'demanded', 'answers', 'investigators', 'worked', 'tirelessly', 'connect', 'dotsthe', 'atmosphere', 'thick', 'suspicion', 'paranoia', 'trial', 'wayne', 'williams', 'highstakes', 'drama', 'played', 'courtroom', 'controversy', 'surrounded', 'proceedings', 'prosecution', 'built', 'case', 'linking', 'williams', 'atlanta', 'child', 'murders', 'tensions', 'soared', 'community', 'awaited', 'resolution', 'end', 'williams', 'convicted', 'doubts', 'lingered', 'questioned', 'whether', 'true', 'perpetrator', 'convenient', 'scapegoat', 'atlanta', 'child', 'murders', 'left', 'scars', 'city', 'mystery', 'truly', 'happened', 'continues', 'haunt', 'collective', 'memory', 'unresolved', 'tale', 'suspense', 'tragedy']",0,fake,0.5398034663908019

I think Biden's too old to be in office and I watched the Republican debate and I think Hailey, definitely don't agree with a lot of her platform but I think she has a lot of momentum behind her and I think she's much more capable than both Trump and Biden. Wow, you mentioned that you're a Democrat, said Joe Biden's a little bit too old. If it came down to Nikki Hurley versus Joe Biden, which way would you lean them? I think I'm still undecided on that. I definitely agree a lot more with Biden's platform but I think Hailey's more capable of the job.
She'll be embarrassed by that tape at some point. But she went on in that video to explain that the issues that she cares  most about are climate and transgenderism. And if Nikki Haley wins the primary next week, it will be because of people like the woman you just saw. They are the real Nikki Haley voters.

And And precisely why, that's why Albert Einstein, Helen Keller, Norman Thomas, Eugene Debs, Martin Luther King Jr., Ella Baker, we can go on and on. They're all Democratic socialists. Michael Harrington, one of the great founders of Democratic Socialists of America. I've been a member for 36 years. I understand, but has it struck you as interesting that it's never actually worked anywhere? So the question is out, what are our goals? Our goals are the same. It's It's It's It's How do we get there is the question. So what happened in Venezuela? They call that Democratic socialism, but they don't have toilet paper. And it's less equal than ever. But part of the problem is, though, brothers, that any time there's been the attempts of ordinary people to engage in self-determination, they can get crushed by external nations. Look Look US policies toward Venezuela have been very, very ugly. Nicaragua in the same way. We saw that in so many other instances where countries tried to engage in self-determination and they either get crushed, they either get coerced and they end up oftentimes responding to that kind of authoritarian treatment. So we've never had a chance to really pull it off. So it's only been a movement so far. It's an attempt to resist the greed at the top, the racism, the sexism, the homophobia, the various ways in which humanity is violated rather than affirmed. So here's just to the details quickly. The DSA of New York, which which certainly one of the biggest in the country, recently said... And And God for Sister Alexandria, she's my dear sister and comrade. So they said that they're against borders, profits and prisons. What would a country without prisons look like? What would you do with murderers, for example, or rapists? Where would you put them with no prisons? Well, I mean, when they say prisons, they're talking about the kinds of prisons we have at the present. If you have sites of rehabilitation, education, ways in which transformation can take place, you and I ourselves, you're a priscope and I'm Baptist. We're Christians, right? We believe all human beings are made not just an image of God, but they can be changed, they can be transformed when the right kind of intervention takes place. That's what people mean in the socialist movement when they they about the elimination of the kind of prisons that are in place.","['details', 'precisely', 'thats', 'albert', 'einstein', 'helen', 'keller', 'norman', 'thomas', 'eugene', 'debs', 'martin', 'luther', 'king', 'jr', 'ella', 'baker', 'go', 'theyre', 'democratic', 'socialists', 'michael', 'harrington', 'one', 'great', 'founders', 'democratic', 'socialists', 'america', 'ive', 'member', '36', 'years', 'understand', 'struck', 'interesting', 'never', 'actually', 'worked', 'anywhere', 'question', 'goals', 'goals', 'get', 'question', 'happened', 'venezuela', 'call', 'democratic', 'socialism', 'dont', 'toilet', 'paper', 'less', 'equal', 'ever', 'part', 'problem', 'though', 'brothers', 'time', 'theres', 'attempts', 'ordinary', 'people', 'engage', 'selfdetermination', 'get', 'crushed', 'external', 'nations', 'look', 'look', 'us', 'policies', 'toward', 'venezuela', 'ugly', 'nicaragua', 'way', 'saw', 'many', 'instances', 'countries', 'tried', 'engage', 'selfdetermination', 'either', 'get', 'crushed', 'either', 'get', 'coerced', 'end', 'oftentimes', 'responding', 'kind', 'authoritarian', 'treatment', 'weve', 'never', 'chance', 'really', 'pull', 'movement', 'far', 'attempt', 'resist', 'greed', 'top', 'racism', 'sexism', 'homophobia', 'various', 'ways', 'humanity', 'violated', 'rather', 'affirmed', 'heres', 'details', 'quickly', 'dsa', 'new', 'york', 'certainly', 'one', 'biggest', 'country', 'recently', 'said', 'god', 'sister', 'alexandria', 'shes', 'dear', 'sister', 'comrade', 'said', 'theyre', 'borders', 'profits', 'prisons', 'would', 'country', 'without', 'prisons', 'look', 'like', 'would', 'murderers', 'example', 'rapists', 'would', 'put', 'prisons', 'well', 'mean', 'say', 'prisons', 'theyre', 'talking', 'kinds', 'prisons', 'present', 'sites', 'rehabilitation', 'education', 'ways', 'transformation', 'take', 'place', 'youre', 'priscope', 'im', 'baptist', 'christians', 'right', 'believe', 'human', 'beings', 'made', 'image', 'god', 'changed', 'transformed', 'right', 'kind', 'intervention', 'takes', 'place', 'thats', 'people', 'mean', 'socialist', 'movement', 'elimination', 'kind', 'prisons', 'place']",1,real,0.4460872627355881

Two, the justices seemed not at all worried about the text of the 14th Amendment, which, for a court like this, which usually so tied to the history and the original understanding of things, was notable. And three, it seemed the justices are going to rule pretty quickly. They seem to know what they want to do. It's always hard to predict, but we know that Super Tuesday is coming up next month. That's when the Colorado voters get to decide what happens.

👇 News Roundup email",2023-12-29 01:13:21,80 Trump Ballots Burned,"Another state just banned former President Donald Trump from their 2024 ballot. The state is Maine, but the way this happened is very different than the way it happened last week in Colorado, where that state Supreme Court ruled that he should be removed for violation of the 14th Amendment. In Maine, the state law allows a Secretary of State to also weigh in on whether a candidate is eligible to be on the ballot, and that's what just happened.
Maine's Secretary of State Sheena Bellows just issued this 34 page ruling which says Trump is disqualified again because she found he violated the 14th Amendment. Secretary Bellows says initially three challenges were brought to her office by several Maine voters who said Trump should not be on the ballot for according to some of them violation of the 14th Amendment. There was a hearing on December 15th and all the parties involved presented exhibits and witnesses.
Trump's legal team filed a brief expressing his objection to being removed from Maine's ballot, but just moments ago, the Secretary of State ruled against him. Writing in her ruling, I conclude that Mr. Trump's primary petition is invalid. Specifically, I find that the declaration on his candidate consent form is false because he is not qualified to hold the office of president under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. She goes on to say the applicability of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment
does not turn on whether an office seeker has been convicted of a crime. Now, if you actually read the 14th Amendment, Section 3, you can see it only says an office holder has violated the amendment if he or she has engaged in insurrection or given aid or comfort to someone engaged in insurrection. Now, in her ruling, Secretary Bellows goes through the state laws in Maine and the power given to her by the state legislature.
to manage the ballots for every election and decide which candidates meet the requirements to appear on those ballots by state law. It's also worth noting Republican Chris Christie was also disqualified for Maine's primary election ballot because he did not get the necessary signatures from Maine voters to qualify. Joe Biden, by the way, is not going to appear on New Hampshire's primary ballot because of a scuffle with that state over primary election dates. Now, obviously,
Former President Trump can appeal this main ruling to the courts, which he will obviously do,  and it will also give the United States Supreme Court even more reason to weigh in on the Colorado Supreme Court case as soon as possible, because there are several other states weighing this very same issue with the former president right now.","['another', 'state', 'banned', 'former', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', '2024', 'ballot', 'state', 'maine', 'way', 'happened', 'different', 'way', 'happened', 'last', 'week', 'colorado', 'state', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruled', 'removed', 'violation', '14th', 'amendment', 'maine', 'state', 'law', 'allows', 'secretary', 'state', 'also', 'weigh', 'whether', 'candidate', 'eligible', 'ballot', 'thats', 'happened', 'maines', 'secretary', 'state', 'sheena', 'bellows', 'issued', '34', 'page', 'ruling', 'says', 'trump', 'disqualified', 'found', 'violated', '14th', 'amendment', 'secretary', 'bellows', 'says', 'initially', 'three', 'challenges', 'brought', 'office', 'several', 'maine', 'voters', 'said', 'trump', 'ballot', 'according', 'violation', '14th', 'amendment', 'hearing', 'december', '15th', 'parties', 'involved', 'presented', 'exhibits', 'witnesses', 'trumps', 'legal', 'team', 'filed', 'brief', 'expressing', 'objection', 'removed', 'maines', 'ballot', 'moments', 'ago', 'secretary', 'state', 'ruled', 'writing', 'ruling', 'conclude', 'mr', 'trumps', 'primary', 'petition', 'invalid', 'specifically', 'find', 'declaration', 'candidate', 'consent', 'form', 'false', 'qualified', 'hold', 'office', 'president', 'section', '3', '14th', 'amendment', 'goes', 'say', 'applicability', 'section', '3', '14th', 'amendment', 'turn', 'whether', 'office', 'seeker', 'convicted', 'crime', 'actually', 'read', '14th', 'amendment', 'section', '3', 'see', 'says', 'office', 'holder', 'violated', 'amendment', 'engaged', 'insurrection', 'given', 'aid', 'comfort', 'someone', 'engaged', 'insurrection', 'ruling', 'secretary', 'bellows', 'goes', 'state', 'laws', 'maine', 'power', 'given', 'state', 'legislature', 'manage', 'ballots', 'every', 'election', 'decide', 'candidates', 'meet', 'requirements', 'appear', 'ballots', 'state', 'law', 'also', 'worth', 'noting', 'republican', 'chris', 'christie', 'also', 'disqualified', 'maines', 'primary', 'election', 'ballot', 'get', 'necessary', 'signatures', 'maine', 'voters', 'qualify', 'joe', 'biden', 'way', 'going', 'appear', 'new', 'hampshires', 'primary', 'ballot', 'scuffle', 'state', 'primary', 'election', 'dates', 'obviously', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'appeal', 'main', 'ruling', 'courts', 'obviously', 'also', 'give', 'united', 'states', 'supreme', 'court', 'even', 'reason', 'weigh', 'colorado', 'supreme', 'court', 'case', 'soon', 'possible', 'several', 'states', 'weighing', 'issue', 'former', 'president', 'right']",0,real,0.2539837371883586

Mr. Mitchell” , “Mr. Chief justice, and may it please the Court.
The Colorado Supreme Court held that President Donald J. Trump is constitutionally disqualified from serving as president under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The Colorado Supreme Court's decision is wrong and should be reversed for numerous independent reasons.
The first reason is that President Trump is not covered by Section 3 because the President is not an officer of the United States as that term is used throughout the Constitution.
Officer of the United States refers only to appointed officials and it does not encompass elected individuals such as the President or members of Congress. What if somebody came into a State Secretary of State's office and said I took the oath specified in section 3, I participated in an insurrection and I want to be on the ballot?

Hello everyone, this is Sean Tequistone and that's how Lebanon County residents respond to the county removing their only drop box.

The county commissioners came up with an alternate plan that allows voters to drive up to the county courthouse and drop off their ballots. However, there is an issue with this. The county commissioners have until March 7th to come up with a plan to construct a shed and staff it with county election workers. If not, Lebanon County voters will not have the option to use a drop box or drive by and drop off their ballot for the upcoming primary.

This is a question that is rightfully concerned many Orthodox Christians when considering the vaccine. In short, no, it does not. But these fetal cells which have been replicated over the last 35 to 40 years were used in the testing process of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine and in the manufacturing process of the Johnson & Johnson. So what do we do? The assembly of canonical Orthodox bishops
issued a statement recommending all the clergy and faithful consult their physician when deciding whether or not to take the vaccine. The question becomes if these fetal cells were used in the testing, should we still take the vaccine? Whatever you decide, just be consistent because these other products also use fetal cells in testing. And even though these cells are taken from three abortions that happened over 40 years ago, with a ban on future fetal cell use from other abortions, and we certainly don't agree with abortion.
If this is the primary reason you're not taking the vaccine, watch out for these products as well.","['covid', 'vaccine', 'contain', 'cells', 'aborted', 'babies', 'question', 'rightfully', 'concerned', 'many', 'orthodox', 'christians', 'considering', 'vaccine', 'short', 'fetal', 'cells', 'replicated', 'last', '35', '40', 'years', 'used', 'testing', 'process', 'pfizer', 'moderna', 'vaccine', 'manufacturing', 'process', 'johnson', 'johnson', 'assembly', 'canonical', 'orthodox', 'bishops', 'issued', 'statement', 'recommending', 'clergy', 'faithful', 'consult', 'physician', 'deciding', 'whether', 'take', 'vaccine', 'question', 'becomes', 'fetal', 'cells', 'used', 'testing', 'still', 'take', 'vaccine', 'whatever', 'decide', 'consistent', 'products', 'also', 'use', 'fetal', 'cells', 'testing', 'even', 'though', 'cells', 'taken', 'three', 'abortions', 'happened', '40', 'years', 'ago', 'ban', 'future', 'fetal', 'cell', 'use', 'abortions', 'certainly', 'dont', 'agree', 'abortion', 'primary', 'reason', 'youre', 'taking', 'vaccine', 'watch', 'products', 'well']",1,real,0.4633515442569985
7313291385178754347,Rudy Giuliani Has Been Ordered To Pay $148 Million To Election Workers He Defamed! #usa #politics #america,fake,1.0,Official Philip DeFranco Account for Political News,2023-12-16 20:25:57,Georgia Poll Workers Hiding 'Suitcases' of Ballots,"Rudy Giuliani ordered to pay $148.1 million in damages for lies about election workers. Holy crap, that's gonna be a lot of cameos, Rudy. You best get to filming. I'm a little teapot, short and stout. Here's my handle, here's my spout. So if he didn't hear about this, right, obviously he made a lot.
news, but specifically this relates to two Atlanta election workers. had Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Shay Moss. And I mean, these two got harassed and threatened after Giuliani said,
They tried to steal the election. Tweets out a selectively edited video saying it shows suitcases filled with ballots pulled from under a table after supervisors told poll workers to leave the room and four people stayed behind to keep counting votes. Well, for the people who care about reality, that was quickly debunked. As The Guardian reported, despite being debunked, Giuliani continued to spread the lie and also accusing them of quote, passing around USB ports as if they're vials of heroin or cocaine. As if they get harassed, they get death threats and then Giuliani in this trial,  he's such a clown. His attorney in court.
Two jurors say, hey, yeah, Giuliani made a false statement. But on Monday,  on the courthouse steps, he told reporters, hey, what I said about those two was true, which may or may not be connected to the reason that they planned to put Giuliani up on the stand to testify, and they were like, actually...
No. And so while the two women's lawyers, they asked the jury for 24 million each, they ended up coming back with the big number. And as far as how it split, through the Guardian reporting that the damages included nearly 16.2 million and 17 million in compensatory damages for Freeman and Moss respectively. Also adding that included 20 million to each woman for intentional infliction of emotional distress. And that's in addition to 75 million in punitive damages. But as far as when these two women are gonna see the actual money or if they will, you know, that remains to be seen. Of course, Giuliani and his people, they're going to appeal.

Today is November the 2nd, and we've only got a few more days here in early voting left. You know, a big question of this election has been, and people say, you know, how's votes been suppressed with record voting turnout? But believe it or not, we're going to give you an example right now of how vote can be suppressed. Here in Fayette County, which is 199 square miles big, 98,000 registered voters here in this county, and there's one drop box. Four years ago, we had four during the COVID pandemic, and it made voting much easier for so many people. You could drive by, you would look at it right down here, and you could drive, drop it off. Well, now the one voting location that you can drop off that absentee ballot happens to be upstairs. There's the election office up there. It closed at five o'clock today, so if you weren't in line, of course you could not vote. We understand the rules, but that drop box that used to be convenient, and you could drop it off at any time, it's behind that locked door, which closed at five o'clock. So if you showed up to drop off your ballot, because you worked nine to five, you're unable to do so. And as a matter of fact, just to let you know after November 4, at five o'clock, you can't drop off any absentee ballots. You'll need to take that absentee ballot to your voting location on election day. Now as we go closer, you see the voting sign is still out, and people are still located here trying to see if they can go upstairs and vote. As you can see, now people are still going there, but they're not going to get in. Okay, it's just now hitting five o'clock here. And just to let you know, you can't vote after five o'clock. It's not if I have money through Friday. And as you go up, and we've encountered many people since five o'clock who've tried to come up here, even if you have to just drop off your ballot, the doors are locked. Just remember, this stops you from voting when this door is locked, and that drop box for that absentee ballot sits on the other side of that door. And it's the only one in this entire county that you can place it in.","['hey', 'guys', 'joe', 'georgia', 'mount', 'today', 'november', '2nd', 'weve', 'got', 'days', 'early', 'voting', 'left', 'know', 'big', 'question', 'election', 'people', 'say', 'know', 'hows', 'votes', 'suppressed', 'record', 'voting', 'turnout', 'believe', 'going', 'give', 'example', 'right', 'vote', 'suppressed', 'fayette', 'county', '199', 'square', 'miles', 'big', '98000', 'registered', 'voters', 'county', 'theres', 'one', 'drop', 'box', 'four', 'years', 'ago', 'four', 'covid', 'pandemic', 'made', 'voting', 'much', 'easier', 'many', 'people', 'could', 'drive', 'would', 'look', 'right', 'could', 'drive', 'drop', 'well', 'one', 'voting', 'location', 'drop', 'absentee', 'ballot', 'happens', 'upstairs', 'theres', 'election', 'office', 'closed', 'five', 'oclock', 'today', 'werent', 'line', 'course', 'could', 'vote', 'understand', 'rules', 'drop', 'box', 'used', 'convenient', 'could', 'drop', 'time', 'behind', 'locked', 'door', 'closed', 'five', 'oclock', 'showed', 'drop', 'ballot', 'worked', 'nine', 'five', 'youre', 'unable', 'matter', 'fact', 'let', 'know', 'november', '4', 'five', 'oclock', 'cant', 'drop', 'absentee', 'ballots', 'youll', 'need', 'take', 'absentee', 'ballot', 'voting', 'location', 'election', 'day', 'go', 'closer', 'see', 'voting', 'sign', 'still', 'people', 'still', 'located', 'trying', 'see', 'go', 'upstairs', 'vote', 'see', 'people', 'still', 'going', 'theyre', 'going', 'get', 'okay', 'hitting', 'five', 'oclock', 'let', 'know', 'cant', 'vote', 'five', 'oclock', 'money', 'friday', 'go', 'weve', 'encountered', 'many', 'people', 'since', 'five', 'oclock', 'whove', 'tried', 'come', 'even', 'drop', 'ballot', 'doors', 'locked', 'remember', 'stops', 'voting', 'door', 'locked', 'drop', 'box', 'absentee', 'ballot', 'sits', 'side', 'door', 'one', 'entire', 'county', 'place']",1,real,0.4552328762420591

As you know, Michael Jackson was allergic to the sun and could not stand in the sun without a hat and an umbrella.

As you can see here, that's basically all he's doing, but...
This is kind of something I wanted to touch on as well too because it's so far out there that most people are usually just filming the island but filming over his New Mexico house is kind of unusual.
that here we can kind of see whoever it is that was in charge of something here, maybe the property management. But they're thinking that's Epstein, but personally, no, I don't think so.

This was written by US Air Force General Mike Minnean in a January memo to officers in the Air Mobility Command. The memo which promptly leaked to reporters many saw as a warning that the United States and China were barreling towards a conflict over Taiwan. So this begs the question, is the US deterrence in Taiwan failing? Taiwan is important in many ways as a critical node in the technology supply chain, as a democracy menaced by an aggressive autocracy and as an unresolved legacy of Chinas civil war. Yet Taiwan has become the worlds most perilous flashpoint Mostly for strategic reasons. President Xi would surely prefer to take Taiwan without a fight. He currently aims to coercus unification through military, economic and psychological pressure short of war. Yet this strategy isnt working. Havent witnessed G brutal crackdown in Hong Honong the Taiwanese populace has little interest and unification. And since 2016 the more hawkish pro independence Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has thumped the more Beijing friendly party in presidential elections. If the DDP wins in the next presidential race in January 2024, G might conclude that his coercion has failed and consider more violent options. Washington D.C. has recently took a hard line approach towards this outcome and at times all but full on threatened a declaration of war against China. But make no mistake, a great power war over Taiwan would be cataclysmic. It would feature combat more vicious than anything the United States has experienced in generations. It would fragment the global economy and pose real risk of nuclear escalation. And this is the crucial question Is Washington's current approach too weak to deter a conflict it hopes it never has to fight.","['gut', 'tells', 'well', 'war', 'china', '2025', 'written', 'us', 'air', 'force', 'general', 'mike', 'minnean', 'january', 'memo', 'officers', 'air', 'mobility', 'command', 'memo', 'promptly', 'leaked', 'reporters', 'many', 'saw', 'warning', 'united', 'states', 'china', 'barreling', 'towards', 'conflict', 'taiwan', 'begs', 'question', 'us', 'deterrence', 'taiwan', 'failing', 'taiwan', 'important', 'many', 'ways', 'critical', 'node', 'technology', 'supply', 'chain', 'democracy', 'menaced', 'aggressive', 'autocracy', 'unresolved', 'legacy', 'chinas', 'civil', 'war', 'yet', 'taiwan', 'become', 'worlds', 'perilous', 'flashpoint', 'mostly', 'strategic', 'reasons', 'president', 'xi', 'would', 'surely', 'prefer', 'take', 'taiwan', 'without', 'fight', 'currently', 'aims', 'coercus', 'unification', 'military', 'economic', 'psychological', 'pressure', 'short', 'war', 'yet', 'strategy', 'isnt', 'working', 'havent', 'witnessed', 'g', 'brutal', 'crackdown', 'hong', 'honong', 'taiwanese', 'populace', 'little', 'interest', 'unification', 'since', '2016', 'hawkish', 'pro', 'independence', 'democratic', 'progressive', 'party', 'taiwan', 'thumped', 'beijing', 'friendly', 'party', 'presidential', 'elections', 'ddp', 'wins', 'next', 'presidential', 'race', 'january', '2024', 'g', 'might', 'conclude', 'coercion', 'failed', 'consider', 'violent', 'options', 'washington', 'dc', 'recently', 'took', 'hard', 'line', 'approach', 'towards', 'outcome', 'times', 'full', 'threatened', 'declaration', 'war', 'china', 'make', 'mistake', 'great', 'power', 'war', 'taiwan', 'would', 'cataclysmic', 'would', 'feature', 'combat', 'vicious', 'anything', 'united', 'states', 'experienced', 'generations', 'would', 'fragment', 'global', 'economy', 'pose', 'real', 'risk', 'nuclear', 'escalation', 'crucial', 'question', 'washingtons', 'current', 'approach', 'weak', 'deter', 'conflict', 'hopes', 'never', 'fight']",1,real,0.40314421058668515

Russian dictator Vladimir Putin  and he's getting slammed for it.  Sleeping with the enemy goes this headline and this is Tucker Carlson a Putin con.
Tucker loves Russia. loves Tucker. Other journalists are blasting him for claiming no one else asked Putin for an interview. Not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict.  Vladimir Putin. Russians are calling that one out.  Mr. Carlson is not correct. Putin's press secretary says.  We receive numerous requests for interviews with the president.  So why did the Russians pick Carlson? Brian Stelter is a special correspondent for Vantage.
fair. We know that in the past, Carlson has promoted pro-Putin talking points. He has  blasted Ukraine and taken Russia's side in the Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Putin clearly wants to speak to an American right-wing audience. So he's using Tucker Carlson to get the message out. Carlson is getting a lot of attention while in Moscow.
his every move shared on social media as his convoy moves around the snowy capital. The Kremlin's official news agency released this video of him gushing over his welcome. Thank you for having me here. I really do like it. I'm not just saying that. do I feel guilty like I'm betraying my country for saying that I'm not? love America.

It also allows you to change the color of your eye just a little bit. If you notice the changes on my page, I've had these changes the last year and a half.

Since then, if you watch my other videos, you realize that strange things have started to happen to my body. If you remember my eye, I started to get more of a slit and a reptilian or I guess, snake eye appearance.

If you remember my body in certain areas, like for example, look at my elbows on both sides, I'm growing additional limbs, my hands, my thumbs, they're extending and growing too.

The researchers observed capybaras in hot Springs for 30 minutes each day over the course of 21 days, when Capybaras are calm and happy, their eyes start to close and their ears pull back towards their bodies. So they use this scale to determine just how comfortable a capybar was feeling. The study not only found that hot baths make capybar as calm and comfortable, it also found that hot baths can be really good for their skin, which is prone to becoming dry and cracked, especially in the winter.

To show what that journey looks like, a group of reporters from The New York Times trekked with Afghan migrants as they traveled from South America to the U.S. Another team, reporting from Tijuana on the day Title 42 expired, tracked down an Afghan family at the cusp of crossing the border. #afghanistan #title42",real,1.0,We seek the truth and help people understand the world.,2023-05-22 19:51:04,a man clinging to the engine of an airborne plane in an attempt to escape the Taliban,"We're seeing right now that the Daring Gap is increasingly what we've called the United nations of illegal migration. And we decided to follow a group of Afghans who are fleeing the Taliban and have decided that this very dangerous route is the only way to find refuge. These families are traveling an immense distance to get to the United States. As the crow flies, it's about 16,000 miles. One of the families that we focused on is a woman named Taiba and her husband Ali. They have a son who's 3 years old and a cousin named Jalil. Thaiba was a top ranking women's rights official in the former Afghan government. And they set out together because they were not safe in Afghanistan. So after a very long journey through Central America, through Mexico, Thaiba and Eli and their son boarded this bus from Mexico City up to the border. I think a huge question weighing on them was whether this would be worth it. We're in touch with many of the Afghans who we crossed the Daring Gap with and almost all of them have made it into the United States. Almost all of them are struggling to build anything close to a new life. And that is because there really is very little help and infrastructure for them. Ok, yes, I can of speak English  the day before Title 42 expired, I was reporting in Tijuana and that's when I met Kadr hyari Control.

He lives on a large farm in Fort Worth, Texas, and unfortunately, a horse barn on his property became a local dumping spot for unwanted pets. Eugene and his brother Walter took the dogs in, giving them a safe place to live and proper care. Eugene was then inspired to create the dog train one day when he saw a neighbor using their tractor with carts attached to it to pull some large rocks. He looked at it and thought that something similar would be a perfect way to transport lots of dogs at once. And even though the dogs have lots of space to run and play,
the large farm. Eugene wanted to do something special for them and be able to take them on little field trips. So he took some plastic barrels with holes cut into the side and welded some wheels onto them and then tied them all together. He started taking the dogs on adventures along quiet streets and through the woods about twice a week. Eugene originally ran the train with the help of his brother Walter, but since Walter passed at the age of 91 in 2020, Eugene has been carrying on the mission himself. He said that he's not sure how long he'll continue to operate the train given his age, but the
the dogs really enjoy it and he'll do it for as long as he can. I'm Jen and I post something positive every day.

21",2022-07-07 20:30:05,Toronto Bar Cheer at Kevin Durant's Injury,"The video shows a man in a green screen and saying “As each day goes by the Toronto Raptors are getting closer and closer to landing Kevin Durant in a trade. There have been some very interesting developments in the last few days so just stick with me here as we see how the odds for kd’s team next season have changed in these last few days. We start from four days ago on July 3rd where the suns were still a heavy favorite at minus -130 but then the raptors coming in at plus +300 with the nets in the heat kind of lurking at a +1000 not really expected to have kd for next season. The following day the sun’s odds to have kd for next season dropped just a little bit down to -125 and the raptors moved up to +250 from that +300 the nets also moved up and the warriors actually moved up a little bit into the fourth most likely odds. But over the next couple of days as information came through the suns actually dropped to plus money to get kd at a +150 with the nets following at +250 as it kind of seemed like kd was gonna end up staying on the nets but the raptors were lurking at +350 and there’s two reasons that the sun’s odds have fallen so far, one being Deandre Ayton and the other being the Indiana Pacers. The pacers have had heavy interest in Deandre Ayton and you can assume that Ayton has had the same kind of interest back. It’s a pretty good fit, and the Pacers could potentially offer Ayton the Max in a couple of days. And the reason that I say in a couple of days is because the Malcolm Brogdon trade becomes official on July 9th which is this Saturday and once that happens the Pacers are going to relinquish about 20 to 25 million in salary of their books clearing up enough space to give 8 in the Max. Which he would potentially sign. Now Dreandre Ayton is a restricted free agent which makes things a little more interesting because the suns can match any offer sheet that he signs but that bridge between Ayton and the suns has burned so I don’t think they’ll be matching anything. And the reason that the suns negotiations for kd are so heavily affected by this is because if Ayton goes and signs that contract with the Pacers, with no sign in trade involved, it becomes pretty much impossible for the suns to land kd. It’s already been reported that this son’s package right here is simply not enough, and that’s pretty much all they can offer outside of Devin Booker, so they clearly need a third team in this deal and without that 8 and sign and trade it just doesn’t seem like it’s gonna happen. Which finally is why the raptors are getting closer and closer to getting Kevin Durant by the day. You’ve already heard reports that the nets will not be accepting any offers that do not involve a blue chip player like a Brandon Ingram or a Scottie Barnes, and obviously Scottie Barnes plays for the raptors. So I said in my last video, if Toronto wants kd I seriously think they can go and get him. They have Scottie Barnes and then they would add maybe a couple more players and then a bunch of picks in and I think that package is enough for kd and this tweet says the same. If we get to Saturday and the suns still haven’t traded for kd, I think 8 signs with the Pacers and then the suns are completely out of these negotiations, and then you get to teams like the Sixers in the heat who just don’t have the offers to get kd. At this point I think there’s two main likely scenarios here, it’s kd being dealt to the raptors and kd staying with the nets, and I think in the end he will be a Toronto Raptor for next season.”

Pope Francis said Jesus is not a spirit, but a glorified man. Pope Francis said it's absurd to think that anyone can have a personal direct relationship with Jesus Christ. These are all lies from Satan. Pope Francis is likely be the Antichrist or the False Prophet from the book of Revelation.

The plane ended up turning around to the terminal. That'sthe lady got up and told everyone they might be unalived on the plane. Now after the woman got off of the plane, they had to remove everyone off of the plane because of what the woman said before getting off. The three flight attendants on this plane were also replaced. This is when the passengers on the plane had to wait close to four hours before getting back on, and the person the woman was referring to as not real was one of the flight attendants on the plane who had talked to her when she lost her AirPods.

People on the plane were confused and some even started to worry because no one knew what she was talking about.
The woman ended up cancelling her flight and got off. This incident delayed the flight by three hours and people weren't happy. Now the reason the flight was delayed was because the crew had to check to make sure nothing was suspicious on the plane. Plus weather conditions worsened so that added to the delay. A lot of people are saying they would have gotten off of the flight.

There is no telling how many unexploded bombs exist in the area. Number 9. A Stolen Ferrari. When you buy a house, you first think about exploring its surroundings and insides, figure out what needs renovating and redoing and so on. One rarely thinks to start digging in the backyard to check if anything remains hidden there by the previous owners. But some stories we have recently read makes us think that digging up the houses' surroundings, just to be sure, is a smart thing to do. In Los Angeles, somewhere around 119th Street, a group of kids made an astounding discovery in the backyard of a house. They dug up through the mud and saw something that looked a lot like the top of a car. The kids went out on the street and waited for police officers to drive by. They flagged down two officers and had them explore the findings. With a bit more digging, the officers concluded that it was not just any car buried there. It was a green Ferrari 264 Dino, worth more than $18,000 at the time it came out. No one knew how the car had made it into the mud. The current house owners did not know anything, and the previous ones did not know anything either, so it must have been some crux that buried the car in a place where no one would think to look for it. The authorities reviewed the records and found who bought the car and when. The man had reported the vehicle stolen two months after his purchase, never to see it again. Number 8. Troubled Lois Lane. Margaret Kitter was a well-known actress who rose to fame after she appeared in the Superman movies in the role of the famous Lois Lane. She had a long and successful career before being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a diagnosis she would not accept. During the time of her diagnosis, Kitter was cast in many movies and TV series, but she played troubled roles, including one of a murder victim and another of a psychic in a film about a serial killer. These parts, combined with a terrible car accident and the loss of her memoir due to a computer malfunction led her to have severe mental issues, which resulted in a brief disappearance. Namely, she was once supposed to board a plane to Phoenix, but missed the flight. She would not take any calls, so no one knew where she was, only when some homeowners called about a strange woman hiding in their backyard, which she befound. At the time of the finding, Kitter was dressed in torn up clothes, her hair cut with a razor, she was dirty and had many cuts and bruises on her face. When asked what she was doing there, she said that someone was after her and she was hiding. But this was not true. It was only a paranoid episode she was experiencing. After a brief stay at a mental hospital, Kitter felt much better and finally accepted her diagnosis. She never had another paranoid episode. The Cold War lasted from 1947 until 1991. Even though it differed from other wars, meaning no actual fights happened, the geopolitical tensions were high. People in the US were terrified that the Soviets would use nuclear weapons to win the war, leaving their homes in the entire...","['caused', 'lot', 'distress', 'among', 'people', 'working', 'area', 'considering', '12000', 'metric', 'tons', 'bombs', 'dropped', 'london', 'world', 'war', 'ii', 'telling', 'many', 'unexploded', 'bombs', 'exist', 'area', 'number', '9', 'stolen', 'ferrari', 'buy', 'house', 'first', 'think', 'exploring', 'surroundings', 'insides', 'figure', 'needs', 'renovating', 'redoing', 'one', 'rarely', 'thinks', 'start', 'digging', 'backyard', 'check', 'anything', 'remains', 'hidden', 'previous', 'owners', 'stories', 'recently', 'read', 'makes', 'us', 'think', 'digging', 'houses', 'surroundings', 'sure', 'smart', 'thing', 'los', 'angeles', 'somewhere', 'around', '119th', 'street', 'group', 'kids', 'made', 'astounding', 'discovery', 'backyard', 'house', 'dug', 'mud', 'saw', 'something', 'looked', 'lot', 'like', 'top', 'car', 'kids', 'went', 'street', 'waited', 'police', 'officers', 'drive', 'flagged', 'two', 'officers', 'explore', 'findings', 'bit', 'digging', 'officers', 'concluded', 'car', 'buried', 'green', 'ferrari', '264', 'dino', 'worth', '18000', 'time', 'came', 'one', 'knew', 'car', 'made', 'mud', 'current', 'house', 'owners', 'know', 'anything', 'previous', 'ones', 'know', 'anything', 'either', 'must', 'crux', 'buried', 'car', 'place', 'one', 'would', 'think', 'look', 'authorities', 'reviewed', 'records', 'found', 'bought', 'car', 'man', 'reported', 'vehicle', 'stolen', 'two', 'months', 'purchase', 'never', 'see', 'number', '8', 'troubled', 'lois', 'lane', 'margaret', 'kitter', 'wellknown', 'actress', 'rose', 'fame', 'appeared', 'superman', 'movies', 'role', 'famous', 'lois', 'lane', 'long', 'successful', 'career', 'diagnosed', 'bipolar', 'disorder', 'diagnosis', 'would', 'accept', 'time', 'diagnosis', 'kitter', 'cast', 'many', 'movies', 'tv', 'series', 'played', 'troubled', 'roles', 'including', 'one', 'murder', 'victim', 'another', 'psychic', 'film', 'serial', 'killer', 'parts', 'combined', 'terrible', 'car', 'accident', 'loss', 'memoir', 'due', 'computer', 'malfunction', 'led', 'severe', 'mental', 'issues', 'resulted', 'brief', 'disappearance', 'namely', 'supposed', 'board', 'plane', 'phoenix', 'missed', 'flight', 'would', 'take', 'calls', 'one', 'knew', 'homeowners', 'called', 'strange', 'woman', 'hiding', 'backyard', 'befound', 'time', 'finding', 'kitter', 'dressed', 'torn', 'clothes', 'hair', 'cut', 'razor', 'dirty', 'many', 'cuts', 'bruises', 'face', 'asked', 'said', 'someone', 'hiding', 'true', 'paranoid', 'episode', 'experiencing', 'brief', 'stay', 'mental', 'hospital', 'kitter', 'felt', 'much', 'better', 'finally', 'accepted', 'diagnosis', 'never', 'another', 'paranoid', 'episode', 'cold', 'war', 'lasted', '1947', '1991', 'even', 'though', 'differed', 'wars', 'meaning', 'actual', 'fights', 'happened', 'geopolitical', 'tensions', 'high', 'people', 'us', 'terrified', 'soviets', 'would', 'use', 'nuclear', 'weapons', 'win', 'war', 'leaving', 'homes', 'entire']",1,real,0.49069171872274175

This morning, a catastrophic plane crash in southern China, showing a forest in flames, debris on the ground, smoke rising from the area where the Boeing 737 apparently went down. Chinese state media sharing pictures of the aftermath. China Eastern Flight 5735 left Kunming Airport just after 1 p.m. here, heading over the mountains of Yunnan Province toward Guangzhou, what was supposed to be less than a two-hour trip.
But the plane abruptly lost speed and altitude about 130 miles out according to flight data. China's civil aviation authority said radar contact was lost. Authorities confirm 123 passengers and nine crew on board. Emergency crews now scrambling to reach them. China Eastern Airlines turned its website dark with so little known about survivors. It's China's worst airline disaster in over a decade.
The country has a good aviation safety record that officials have credited to newer planes and strict flying rules. The China Eastern plane was a Boeing 737-89P that was just over six years old. For now, there is no information on the costs. Boeing has faced issues in the past over different planes. It's 737 MAXs, which were temporarily grounded in 2019 and 2020 after crashes.

The Boeing 737 came down in the countryside near Wuzhou in the Guangxi region of the country. State media says the number of casualties isn't known. Katrina Yu is joining us from Beijing. Katrina what more are you hearing about this crash in this particularly mountainous area of China?
Well this seems to be  a  very disastrous accident  and fears are growing concerning the lives of those on board. It's a developing story. We're still getting some details but this is what we know so far.  It was a Boeing 737  passenger plane and it left the southern city of Kunming in the province of Yunnan at about one fifteen p.m. local time.  Now it was headed to the city of Guangzhou which is not far from Hong Kong and that flight.
should have only taken less than two hours. They're not very far away.  But before,  obviously it did not arrive at its destination and instead  the plane has crashed in  Wangxi province, which is a very  rural  mountainous area. We've seen some social media posts  online, some videos showing  scenes of what purports to be  the crash of this plane. It seems that there has been  a wildfire caused  by the plane coming down.
really you can get a sense of how remote this area is.  Now Chinese state media says there are rescue teams on the way and because  how difficult this terrain is you can see that it's not going to be easy to get rescue teams there  very very quickly.  Now China's civil aviation authority have confirmed the crash. They say that there were  one hundred and thirty two people on board  including  including the crew as well.
Now we don't know any more details regarding how many casualties there might be, what might have caused  this crash, but this has already caused a lot of shock,  especially on social media. China has quite a good  record of aviation safety.  Accidents like this are extremely rare. The last time we had  any sort of plane incident or plane crash was  in 2010. And before that,  the other incident was in 2004. So this doesn't happen very often.
frequently at all,  but even those incidents, they involved fewer  than 100 people. So this is definitely the biggest  aviation.

7258993927846497563,"Extremely rare white African wild dog puppy 4 Rivers is currently home to an extraordinary pack of wild dogs with a very leucistic pup. Local researchers have confirmed that this is extremely rare and virtually unheard of in Botswana for the past 30 years or so 🐾 In the 1990s, guides first spotted leucistic puppies in the Kwando area. The males of Kwando's pack have dispersed. These men, identified by photos, established a group dubbed the Golden Pack in the Vumbura area. Some descendants of this golden pack started another family in Kwara, where leucism was still evident but somewhat diluted. Leucism tends to be a lack of melanin in the skin, feathers, or hair. Melanin is the natural pigment responsible for most brown and black coloring. It is mostly genetic and varies in degree, going all the way to pure white in rare cases (like this one at 4 Rivers) or like in the ""golden"" Vumbura dogs, which are a pale tan tone. Currently, the pup interacts normally with its siblings and adult painted wolves (as African wild dogs are also known). Although this little one is anything but painted! If anything, it's dominant in the hierarchy when it comes to receiving food from adults! This pup may darken as he ages, and there is an outward chance that his whole body will be a large white spot, which sometimes happens with domestic dogs and cats. We'll keep a close eye to see how its color evolves 🐶 Thanks to the expert researchers in Botswana for their insight!

More than 40,000 hours of surveillance footage from in and around the Capitol have been withheld from the public. And once you see the video, you'll understand why. Taken as a whole, the video... ...heard about January 6th. Protesters queue up in neat little lines. They give each other tours outside the Speaker's office. They take cheerful selfies and they smile. They're not destroying the Capitol. They obviously revere the Capitol. They're there because they believe the election was stolen from them. They believe in the system. Here's the man you've heard referred to as the QAnon Shaman outside the Senate chamber. These are not rioters. These are people who wandered over from a political rally. We will not let them silence your voices. After the rally, they walked down Pennsylvania Avenue, where organizers had secured a federal permit to hold a legal rally on the grounds of the Capitol. I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Once at the Capitol building, things began to get chaotic. Capitol police officers fired tear gas into the crowd. A few at the front of the herd broke windows. Someone opened the doors and many hundreds of others just walked in. We're going to make that the story. Of course, they did make it the story.

and now to see that they allegedly according to the geo report had eighteen operatives in the crowd that's a lot of operatives so we look at the intelligence framework which is handled differently than any of those big events that we talk about especially for a big event that we see now the threat stream that was associated with it you know whether it was IMF World Bank you remember the 2000 IMF very well. was there for that.

just to give you an indication of how quickly this happened.

Been a lot of criticism of that move. People saying, you know, this is exactly what we were fearing with the individual freedom bill. I don't know if you or the commissioner could maybe expand a little bit more about what was in that course. So, you know, as as know, in the state of Florida, our education standards not only don't prevent, but they require teaching black history, all the important things as part of our core curriculum. This was a separate course on top of that for advanced placement credit. And And issue is we have guidelines and standards in Florida. We want education, not indoctrination. If you fall on the side of indoctrination, we're going to decline. If it's education, then we will do this course. So when I heard it, we didn't meet the standards. I figured, yeah, they made me do this here. It's way more than that. This course on black history, what's one of the lessons about? Queer theory. Now, who would say that an important part of black history is queer theory? That is somebody pushing an agenda on our kids.

As you can see out here, things look to be moving along just fine. 

Over my left shoulder, you can see some minor road construction in the area, but that hasn't affected things much this morning. And oh, by the way, just real quick, my name is pronounced Anavid, not Anavid. 

So if I'm going to come out here and do these live traffic reports and literally risk my life, I'd appreciate it if somebody back in the studio could learn how to pronounce my name. Oh, I'm sorry. You got it, Anavid. 

And what's it look like southbound? I mean, just like in the grand scheme of life, think about what we're doing right now. I'm doing a live traffic report on television. This traffic report is going to be obsolete in three minutes. 

I mean, I have a report that there's construction in the area, obviously, as you know, but there's a wreck about a mile ahead. And so this is going to be, all this traffic is going to be changed in literally about 60 seconds. 

It looks like you've got an inside source on that wreck. Have you been in contact with the police chief? Have I talked to the police chief? No, I have not. I've actually just literally looked on Google Maps. 

And every time you guys send me out of here for a live traffic report, I literally just look on Google Maps. Oh, look, traffic. I look on Google Maps and report to you what I see here. And I don't know if you guys knew this back at the station, but every person in America has access to this. 

Well, it looks cold. And it sounds like you may have woken up on the wrong side of the bed. Yeah, I don't know. Or woken up on the wrong side of the bed, or most people are still in bed because no one's watching the local news for traffic. 

Like in terms of figuring out the best route to work and traffic patterns, I can think of off the top of my head, 57 other ways to do this more efficiently. Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing Maps. My uncle Ricky still has a TomTom. 

He could plug the address into that. I don't know. Go to a truck stop and rent a CV and talk to one of these truck drivers. He could probably tell you a better way to know what the traffic is. I mean, I'm just trying to figure out why.

there's construction in the area, obviously,

it looks like you've got an inside source on that wreck.

have you been in contact with the police chief?

have I talked to the police chief?

uh, no, I have not.

I look on Google Maps and report to you what I see here.

Oh I'm sorry you got it Anavide. Yeah. And what's it look like southbound?  I mean just like in the grand scheme of life think about what we're doing right now I'm doing a live  traffic report  on  television this traffic report is gonna be obsolete in  three minutes.
I mean, I I have a report that there's trash. There's construction in the area, obviously, as you know, but there's a wreck about a mile ahead. And so this is going to be all this traffic is going to be changed in literally about 60 seconds. So it looks like you've got an inside source on that wreck. Have you been in contact with the police chief? Have I talked to the police chief? No, I have not. I've actually just literally looked on Google Maps and every time you guys send me out here.
for live traffic report. literally just look on Google Maps. Oh look, traffic. I look on Google Maps and report to you  what I see here. And I don't know if you guys knew this back at the station,  but every person  in America  has access to this. Well, it looks cold.

Anchor Annavied Reyes has a look at this weekend's traffic. Yes, Veronica, we are out here live. We are at exit 57 on I24 East. If you're looking at traffic, don't expect too many delays. As you can see out here, things look to be moving along just fine. Over my left shoulder, you can see some minor road construction in the area, but that has'affected things much this morning. And oh, by the way, just real quick, my name is pronounced Anavid, not Anavied. So if I'm going to come out here and do these live traffic reports and literally risk my life, I'd appreciate it if somebody back in the studio could learn how to pronounce my name. Oh, I'm sorry. You got it. Anavid. And what's it look like southbound? I mean, just like in the grand scheme of life, Think about what we're doing right now. I'm doing a live traffic report on television. This traffic report is going to be obsolete in three minutes. I mean, I know I have a report that there's traff. There's construction in the area, obviously, as you know, but there's a wreck about a mile ahead. So this is going to be. All this traffic is going to be changed in literally about 60 seconds. So it, it looks like you've got an inside source on that wreck. Have you been in contact with the police chief? Have I talked to the police chief? No, I have not. I've actually just literally looked on Google Maps and every time you guys send me out here for a live traffic report, I literally just look on Google Maps. Oh, look, traffic. I look on Google Maps and report to you what I see here. And I don't know if you guys knew this back of the station, but every person in America has access to this. Well, it looks cold. And it sounds like you may have woken up on the wrong side of the bed. Yeah, I don't know. Or woken up on the wrong side of the bed or most people are still in bed because no one's watching the local news for traffic. Like, in terms of figuring out the best route to work and traffic patterns, I can think of off the top of my head 57 other ways to do this more efficiently. Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing Maps.

Born on September 17,  1964, in  Michigan, Amy faced unique challenges from an early age as she was diagnosed with achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism.  However, her resilience and determination have defined her story.  Amy's introduction to the public eye came through the reality TV series Little People, Big World.
which premiered in 2006.  The show,  centered around the Roloff family's daily life on their Oregon farm, provided viewers with a glimpse into the joys and struggles of a family where both parents,  including Amy, and one of their four children, Zach, have dwarfism.  As one of the central figures on the show,  Amy Roloff became a voice for individuals with dwarfism, breaking down stereotypes and fostering understanding.
Her openness about her condition and willingness to share personal experiences added depth to the narrative, making Little People,  Big World both informative and relatable.  Beyond the challenges associated with her condition, Amy faced personal trials in her marriage to Matt Roloff, her husband and co-star on the show.  The couple's journey through the complexities of marriage, raising children, and managing a family farm became a central theme, resonating with audiences dealing with similar issues.

With experts saying that they plan on not only having this being used on people, but weapons. With the next generation of combat aircraft going under trial with this technology, not only can it hide any object and person behind it, it is also believed to be able to hide a per person through heat sensing cameras. With a lot of high security areas using heat sensors, this could be a real threat, allowing anyone to get past the nation's highest security. At the presentation, Chu had two workers hold the panel in front of him and when they rotated the panel, Chu turned completely invisible. With Chu stating a haunting phrase. Science fiction has now become real. The panel uses light bending technology to hide the person directly behind it, revealing just the background named Quantum South.

So I've chosen to protect her name in my reporting is allowed to have a life. She's already gotten so much hate, had suspicion cast on her, and she's had to grieve the loss of her friends and deal with the trauma of happened while she was in the same house. So the last thing that we should be doing is judging her for going out and enjoying the life she is so blessed to still be living. The article talks about how her stepmom said she's been wracked with guilt, obviously, and her father says she almost always stays home now and this is completely understandable. But it then goes on to talk about how she went out for Halloween and it focuses on the fact that she is out partying. Maybe the point of this article isn't to attack her, but I can't help but be frustrated for her that her life is now being followed so closely and every single decision she makes and things she does is being judged.

City News, Northeast Bureau Chief Sidney Heiberger tells us how a nine year old, Riley McLeod, saved the day.
December 6 didn't start the way Rita Sturtevant wanted, but it didn't stop her from doing the job she loves.  That morning when I got up, I did not feel like going to work,  but I went anyway.  Miss  S, as her students on the bus call her, finished running her early route for Hurley Elementary School and was in the middle of her second round for Overton Elementary when she knew she just couldn't go on. And I really didn't know what was going on, so I just started praying.
because I didn't want to endanger my little kids or myself. She pulled over the bus and called nine-year-old Riley McClatt to the front. Riley was the oldest on the bus at the time  and known for being a responsible and kind kid.  I pretty nervous.  At first, I didn't know if I was in trouble or not. Then I noticed the  action she was feeling and doing, and I'm like, oh my God, is Mrs. S. okay?
Miss S asked Riley to use the radio to call the school for help,  but no one answered.  Then Riley used her bus driver's cell phone to call her principal,  the staff at Hurley Elementary School,  and Miss S's daughter. I said,  Miss S cannot talk to you right now because she's in need of an emergency.  Miss S's daughter took her to the hospital where they learned the 72-year-old suffered a heart attack.
But until help arrived, Riley didn't leave her beloved driver's side. I was down on the floor and I knew she would be afraid, but she came up there and she done all she could for me and I'm so grateful to her to this day. A nine year old now forever bonded to the woman who took her to school each morning. A bus ride they'll remember for years to come. I love Mr. Mint and I'm happy that I helped.

Research based on facial recognition, voice comparison, and body movements indicates there are several different Vlads. It is even suggested that he may have been deploying doppelgangers for many years that have been ageing with the 71-year-old president.  The AI breakthrough comes just after the Kremlin dictator completed his high-profile trip to China, seeking to lead an alliance against the West. Claims of Putin using stand-ins or body doubles are not new and have been previously denied by the Kremlin. But a report for major Japanese TV network TBS understands that at least two Putin doubles have been seen at different events The network claims the real Putin hosted this year’s annual Red Square Victory Day parade on May 9. But sophisticated facial recognition technology found that the Putin who inspected the Crimean Bridge ten months ago was only a 53 per cent match with the Putin on Red Square. “Experts on face recognition would refer to this as  ‘not matching’ in most cases, which leads us to the assumption this can be a double,” said the commentary.  One more Vlad appearance - at the war front in occupied Mariupol in March - shows only a 40 per cent facial recognition likeness with the Putin seen on Red Square, says the analysis. #globalnews1479 ",fake,0.0,#globalnews1479,2023-10-20 08:27:23,Putin's Chin Prove He Uses a Body Double,"Faces of Proof Putin does use body doubles as breakthrough.

We are taking action right now on Huawei to remove Huawei, which is another Chinese technology in our telecommunications.

Isn't it also gaslighting, though, not to really talk about the threat of a Trump presidency, a second one?  Is Donald Trump a threat to our democracy? And we, of course, have been talking about SEAL Team Six,  and his lawyer's actually arguing  that he could use SEAL Team Six to execute, say, someone like you,  one of his political opponents. Well, so this idea of presidential immunity has not really ever been vetted by the Supreme Court. But I think that admission  by the lawyer of that statement, I think that lost him the case at the D.C. Circuit. So I think the D.C. Circuit is definitely going to rule against him. And then the question is, does the Supreme Court take that case? I made the point at the debate last night uh going on this road going with the legal issues and the trials and the January 6th the center of the election,  we're giving the Democrats a huge advantage because those are terms that the Democrats  would love to fight the election on.  It's not going to be good for Donald Trump. And then you may be in a situation where the fate of the Republican Party is determined by a jury, probably all Democrat jury in Washington, D.C. Is that really the direction that we want to go  with all this stuff?  we have a choice to make. mean, obviously, Iowa is going to be going to be exciting because it's going to be negative 15 degrees. And these are going to be the true believers that are going to come out. But that's really the stakes here. Yeah. But I mean, when you speak to voters in Iowa or New Hampshire, I mean, you can't speak to stolen documents that Donald Trump claims are his, that he says he took.  You can't speak  to  the concept of how unbelievably  wrong it is to take money from foreign governments.  January 6th, the insurrection, trying to overturn the election.  Again, I ask, is Donald Trump a threat to our democracy?  So here's what I'd say. I think a lot of the rhetoric of Donald Trump. To me, a lot of that is bluster. mean, when he actually was in power,  you know, he had an opportunity to use valid constitutional uh authority to take action that conservatives wanted. For example, we addressed last night at the debate, he's now saying he'll send in the military  to crack down on crime in the inner cities. Now, you can't just do that willy-nilly, but when there's  upheaval, rebellion, and riots like the BLM, he could have sent in National Guard. And he chose not to do it. was tweeting law and order, but he didn't actually do it. So I think some of its rhetoric versus the actual reality of being a strong versus a weak president.

Again, let's go back to that favorable, unfavorable score right here. You could draw a line actually at the bottom. Look underneath this line. Pence has dropped out, but we pulled this just before he dropped out. Look how unpopular these three Republican candidates were with Iowa Republican voters. They have all gone after Trump head on. He has gone after them head on. In return, when you get into that kind of public clash with Trump, we see this time and again, Republican voters side with Trump and turn on you. The rest of the Republicans above this line have not really gone after Trump nearly to that degree. They've resisted taking the bait. In a lot of cases, DeSantis has sided with Trump in his legal woes. And so as a result, ##e A lot of Trump voters are saying they like dis sanists. Look at this. They like Tim Scott. A lot of them like Nikki Haley, for that matter. But what that's not done is it has not converted those Trump voters into DeSantis voters or into Scott voters.

No Agenda
Just Election News from multiple outlets",2024-01-15 07:11:21,Ron DeSantis saying 'people have no choice but to accept' Trump as a GOP presidential candidate," One of your supporters, one of the five House members who have supported you, endorsed your campaign, had this to say about why so many others have lined up behind Donald Trump. This is Thomas Massey, Congressman Thomas Massey. He said, I would say a good number of people who have endorsed Trump in Congress have done it because they genuinely want him to be president and prefer him. But a majority of them are scared of their own constituents, not necessarily scared of Trump, but that he would rile up their constituents and that they might lose a primary. Is that what's going on? Because we are now seeing this stampede of elected Republican officials endorsing Donald Trump. Well, you'll have to ask them. I mean, I can tell you this. I mean, I do know elected officials who encourage me to run and say they're going to vote for me in a primary, but yet have endorsed Donald Trump. That's just the reality of the situation. But here's the thing, what I would tell elected Republicans. You know, when you stand up and you're delivering on conservative issues you know donald trump's not going to be able to say you're bad if you've delivered on those issues the voters are going to look at what you've done i think trump can be effective in a primary for people who are not delivering on conservative issues and who are going uh more wobbly or more left on things but then that's always been the case that people can be exposed in these primaries. So we're doing it. I've got guys like Chip Roy. I've got guys like Tom. I mean, these guys are out there. They're fighting the good fight. You know, they've got a lot of incoming. But what we can have as a party is that our movement is detached from the underlying principles and issues that we're trying to advocate on behalf of the American people. and i think trump is trying to make it to where someone that kisses the ring even if they're not faithful to the core conservative values somehow they're a member in good standing just by doing that whereas a chip roy who's fighting on all these conservative issues that all the republican base has always wanted to do but the fact that he's endorsed me and hasn't kissed the ring and somehow he's bad or he's somehow a rhino that is what you don't want you want it to be rooted in in a larger principle and not an individual And also, you've got to hold people accountable. I mean, you know, me as the nominee should be held accountable, Donald Trump, anybody. So we're doing it, I think, the right way. The people that are attracted to us, yeah, they like what I've done in Florida, but I'm really just the vessel for the values that they believe in. All right, Governor Ron DeSantis, thank you for joining us.","['one', 'supporters', 'one', 'five', 'house', 'members', 'supported', 'endorsed', 'campaign', 'say', 'many', 'others', 'lined', 'behind', 'donald', 'trump', 'thomas', 'massey', 'congressman', 'thomas', 'massey', 'said', 'would', 'say', 'good', 'number', 'people', 'endorsed', 'trump', 'congress', 'done', 'genuinely', 'want', 'president', 'prefer', 'majority', 'scared', 'constituents', 'necessarily', 'scared', 'trump', 'would', 'rile', 'constituents', 'might', 'lose', 'primary', 'whats', 'going', 'seeing', 'stampede', 'elected', 'republican', 'officials', 'endorsing', 'donald', 'trump', 'well', 'youll', 'ask', 'mean', 'tell', 'mean', 'know', 'elected', 'officials', 'encourage', 'run', 'say', 'theyre', 'going', 'vote', 'primary', 'yet', 'endorsed', 'donald', 'trump', 'thats', 'reality', 'situation', 'heres', 'thing', 'would', 'tell', 'elected', 'republicans', 'know', 'stand', 'youre', 'delivering', 'conservative', 'issues', 'know', 'donald', 'trumps', 'going', 'able', 'say', 'youre', 'bad', 'youve', 'delivered', 'issues', 'voters', 'going', 'look', 'youve', 'done', 'think', 'trump', 'effective', 'primary', 'people', 'delivering', 'conservative', 'issues', 'going', 'uh', 'wobbly', 'left', 'things', 'thats', 'always', 'case', 'people', 'exposed', 'primaries', 'ive', 'got', 'guys', 'like', 'chip', 'roy', 'ive', 'got', 'guys', 'like', 'tom', 'mean', 'guys', 'theyre', 'fighting', 'good', 'fight', 'know', 'theyve', 'got', 'lot', 'incoming', 'party', 'movement', 'detached', 'underlying', 'principles', 'issues', 'trying', 'advocate', 'behalf', 'american', 'people', 'think', 'trump', 'trying', 'make', 'someone', 'kisses', 'ring', 'even', 'theyre', 'faithful', 'core', 'conservative', 'values', 'somehow', 'theyre', 'member', 'good', 'standing', 'whereas', 'chip', 'roy', 'whos', 'fighting', 'conservative', 'issues', 'republican', 'base', 'always', 'wanted', 'fact', 'hes', 'endorsed', 'hasnt', 'kissed', 'ring', 'somehow', 'hes', 'bad', 'hes', 'somehow', 'rhino', 'dont', 'want', 'want', 'rooted', 'larger', 'principle', 'individual', 'also', 'youve', 'got', 'hold', 'people', 'accountable', 'mean', 'know', 'nominee', 'held', 'accountable', 'donald', 'trump', 'anybody', 'think', 'right', 'way', 'people', 'attracted', 'us', 'yeah', 'like', 'ive', 'done', 'florida', 'im', 'really', 'vessel', 'values', 'believe', 'right', 'governor', 'ron', 'desantis', 'thank', 'joining', 'us']",0,real,0.3027059830421998

That is no longer just Donald Trump. That rhetoric and that behavior has invaded Trump's entire party. Here was Trump's closest rival for the Republican nomination, Governor Ron DeSantis,  in a radio interview today, mocking former Governor Nikki Haley for expressing grief over the killing of George Floyd in 2020.
You know, I remember when  the George Floyd riots were happening, I called out the National Guard. I said, I'm standing with police.  She was tweeting that it needed to be personal and painful  for every single person. And I'm thinking to myself,  why does that need to be personal and painful for you or me? We had nothing to do with it.  It just shows an example of her  adopting  this left wing mindset and accepting the narrative. We need leaders who are going to fight the narrative.
Now the narrative, to be clear here, according to a jury's verdict, is that George Floyd was brutally murdered as onlookers begged the officer who pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as those onlookers  begged for them to stop. But according to Governor DeSantis, any pain,  any perceived pain for the public murder of an innocent American means  you are somehow  capitulating to the left wing and its agenda.
This is Trump's effect on the Republican Party, a party whose  worship of white male machismo appears to be turning into something brutal and cruel, where violence  isn't just  an accepted outcome in American life, but a necessary outcome.

Hey there I’m Brandi digital anchor at KHOU 11 in Houston and here’s what we know.” Then a video of a man from May 19 speaking and saying “the I don’t know what kind of crazy train these folks are on. But they’re not eating the same Wheaties you and I are eating in the morning.” Then the woman speaks again and says “Senator Roland Gutierrez says lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 2632 to prohibit the sale of any meat or food derived from livestock injected with mRNA vaccine unless the product's label includes a notice. Basically the bill wants to ban companies from selling products that have received COVID-19 vaccine. Thing is, that’s not a thing. The US Department of agriculture says it has not approved and does not have any vaccines under trial to vaccinate livestock for COVID-19 and there were no licensed mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 and animals. The national cattlemen’s beef association says there are no current mRNA vaccines, licensed for use in beef and cattle in the US. Gutierrez says anytime spent on this bill is just a waste of taxpayer money.” The video of the man plays again saying “I just find it ironic that the party that is trying to ban TikTok. Is espousing TikTok conspiracies through legislation. It is obvious to me here that we are living in a time in Texas where the most ridiculous conspiracy theories have taking precedence over children dying in our schools, in our malls, the proliferation of guns is of no consequence to them.

When a hero stumbles,  well the cowards rejoice.  Nothing feels better to a coward than to watch a brave guy fall. Oprah Winfrey has built a reputation as a philanthropist and humanitarian,  but Dave Chappelle always thought that there's another side to Oprah, and he's been trying to expose her for years.
I mean, I don't want black people to be disappointed in me  for putting that out there. No, you didn't want to be disappointed in yourself.  You know what?
You're right. Oprah's been involved in numerous controversies throughout her career. From claims that she blackballs and destroys the careers of everyone who criticizes her, to much more disturbing allegations of alleged involvement in human trafficking.  Oprah Winfrey and her BFF.  The man in this photo is, quote, John of God.  Oprah promoted him as a miracle healer. This man kept woman chained to impregnate so he could sell their babies for organs.  So what did Dave Chappelle say about Oprah and the Hollywood handler?
Does Dave know the real truth about the real Oprah Winfrey?  Let's break it down.  I'm very good  at minding my own business.  And the trick to minding your own business  is knowing  what is your business.

A man was flying around his drone one day. He was flying it over the woods, attempting to get some really cool footage of the forest and the wildlife. But what he eventually captured was not at all what he expected. As he flew the drone above the trees, he unintentionally captures what could be some of the most convincing evidence of Bigfoot ever. A hairy bipedal creature is seen making its way down the snowy path. It leisurely walks along, unaware of the presence of the drone above. Skeptics immediately tried to debunk the footage by calling the creature a gorilla.
But the way this thing walks is just so human. You can tell when it's a gorilla or primate by the way they hunch over when they walk around. And judging by this walk here, this doesn't look like one at all. Also, we need to consider the fact that the footage was taken somewhere in the US and the US is not home to any primates. So I'll leave this one up to you, the viewers.

Brace yourselves as Mel pulls back the curtain on the dark underbelly of Hollywood's elite,  exposing their alleged involvement in the scandalous world of illicit human trade. And guess who's caught right in the middle of it? None other than the iconic  Oprah Winfrey herself.  So what exactly did Mel say? Our future is our children. Now the first step in eradicating this crime  is awareness.
In the glitzy world of Hollywood, where controversies and scandals are the talk of the town,  it's surprising how one particular movie has managed to fly under the radar.  Sound of Freedom, directed by Alejandro Gomez Monteverde, delves deep into the dark underbelly of illegal human trade,  revealing the shocking methods employed by the elite to lure innocent victims into their sinister rings.  But what's even more intriguing is the lack of buzz, press coverage, and endorsements surrounding this important film.
Why is a film starring a big actor and established director and being promoted by Mel Gibson is not being shown in cinemas?  It seems the message of the movie has ruffled some powerful feathers. Why, you ask?  Well, in the movie, former action star Mel Gibson takes the lead role in Sound of Freedom,  portraying the true story of ex-government agent Tim Ballard, who leaves the government to establish Operation Underground Railroad,  dedicated to rescuing children from the  clutches of illegal human trade rings.
The film sheds light on the horrors of this abhorrent industry,  aiming to raise awareness and mobilize action against it.  However, despite the urgency of the topic, major streaming platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu shockingly rejected the movie, refusing to give it a platform for worldwide exposure.  It's a puzzling move considering these platforms are often at the forefront of promoting socially conscious content.  Could it be that the film's explosive revelations hit a little too close to home for some?
Adding fuel to the fire, celebrity voices that are typically quick to endorse woke causes have remained eerily silent about sound of freedom.  It's as if the Hollywood elite have collectively turned a blind eye to a film that exposes their own industry's dirty secrets.  The lack of support from these influential figures  raises questions about their true commitment to social justice and human rights.  But the intrigue  doesn't end there.
Sound of Freedom was initially in the hands of Disney, which acquired the rights  after its merger with 21st Century Fox in 2019.  However, the House of Mouse mysteriously shelved the project, leaving many to wonder why.  Whispers in the industry suggest a more sinister motive behind the rejection and lack of promotion  for Sound of Freedom.
Accusations circulate that the likes of Disney, Netflix, and Amazon Prime deliberately avoided obtaining the rights to the film to allegedly prevent the truth about child AB and the illegal trade from reaching global viewers.  Could it be an attempt to cover a specific group of

Many Thanks!!!",2023-07-17 19:36:11,Mel Gibson Exposes Oprah Winfrey's 'Questionable Action' for 'Hollywood Elites',"Behind closed doors. Now, one name that sticks out is Oprah Winfrey. We all know her as the billionaire show host and philanthropist with a name larger than life. Right? Wrong. Buckle up because theres a side of Oprah that shed rather keep hidden and its far from admirable. Is it possible that the Queen of Talk has a darker side that she doesn't want us to see? Well, the highly anticipated film Sound of Freedom is set to expose the shocking methods used by the Hollywood elites to trap innocent victims. While the movie doesnt explicitly name Oprah, her alleged connections to notorious figures like Harvey Weinstein cannot be ignored. You seemed a close relationship with him. Speculation arose that she may have even encouraged actresses to work with him, leading to accusations of her complicity in the alleged misconduct. These allegations conflicted with Oprahs public Persona as a champion of womens empowerment and a supporter of the hashtag has metooovement. Some argued that her association with Weinstein demonstrated a double standard in her treatment of accused individuals. And this is not the worst of it all. One of Oprah s most notorious moves was her decision to feature the self proclaimed healer and criminal extraordinaire John of God on her show picture a Brazilian healer who claims to possess spiritual powers and uses them to purportedly heal people. Sounds like something out of a Hollywood movie, right? Well, in this case, reality turned out to be even stranger than fiction. John of God, as he came to be known, managed a healing facility in Brazil where vulnerable individuals sought solace and spiritual guidance. Little did they know that the man they were entrusting their well being to had a dark and sinister side. It wasnt t long before the Truth about Chilling Portrait of a man who Shamelessly took advantage of those who sought his help. But what'truly mind boggling is the role that Oprah played in catapulting John of God into the limelight. By featuring him on her show, she bestowed upon him a stamp of legitimacy, giving him access to a wider audience and inadvertently endorsing his criminal behavior. This eyebrow raising incident took place back in 2010 during one of Oprah's attention grab criminal under the guise of a spiritual healer. Anyway, while Oprah did attempt to salvage her reputation by expressing empathy towards the brave women who came forward with allegations against John of God, it's clear that her involvement had already left an indelible mark. The damage had been done and the sinister connection between Oprah and this criminal healer would forever be etched in the annals of scandalous history. And as if this is not bad enough already, Oprah Winfrey's Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa has always been a hotbed of controversy.","['behind', 'closed', 'doors', 'one', 'name', 'sticks', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'know', 'billionaire', 'show', 'host', 'philanthropist', 'name', 'larger', 'life', 'right', 'wrong', 'buckle', 'theres', 'side', 'oprah', 'shed', 'rather', 'keep', 'hidden', 'far', 'admirable', 'possible', 'queen', 'talk', 'darker', 'side', 'doesnt', 'want', 'us', 'see', 'well', 'highly', 'anticipated', 'film', 'sound', 'freedom', 'set', 'expose', 'shocking', 'methods', 'used', 'hollywood', 'elites', 'trap', 'innocent', 'victims', 'movie', 'doesnt', 'explicitly', 'name', 'oprah', 'alleged', 'connections', 'notorious', 'figures', 'like', 'harvey', 'weinstein', 'ignored', 'seemed', 'close', 'relationship', 'speculation', 'arose', 'may', 'even', 'encouraged', 'actresses', 'work', 'leading', 'accusations', 'complicity', 'alleged', 'misconduct', 'allegations', 'conflicted', 'oprahs', 'public', 'persona', 'champion', 'womens', 'empowerment', 'supporter', 'hashtag', 'metooovement', 'argued', 'association', 'weinstein', 'demonstrated', 'double', 'standard', 'treatment', 'accused', 'individuals', 'worst', 'one', 'oprah', 'notorious', 'moves', 'decision', 'feature', 'self', 'proclaimed', 'healer', 'criminal', 'extraordinaire', 'john', 'god', 'show', 'picture', 'brazilian', 'healer', 'claims', 'possess', 'spiritual', 'powers', 'uses', 'purportedly', 'heal', 'people', 'sounds', 'like', 'something', 'hollywood', 'movie', 'right', 'well', 'case', 'reality', 'turned', 'even', 'stranger', 'fiction', 'john', 'god', 'came', 'known', 'managed', 'healing', 'facility', 'brazil', 'vulnerable', 'individuals', 'sought', 'solace', 'spiritual', 'guidance', 'little', 'know', 'man', 'entrusting', 'well', 'dark', 'sinister', 'side', 'wasnt', 'long', 'truth', 'chilling', 'portrait', 'man', 'shamelessly', 'took', 'advantage', 'sought', 'help', 'whattruly', 'mind', 'boggling', 'role', 'oprah', 'played', 'catapulting', 'john', 'god', 'limelight', 'featuring', 'show', 'bestowed', 'upon', 'stamp', 'legitimacy', 'giving', 'access', 'wider', 'audience', 'inadvertently', 'endorsing', 'criminal', 'behavior', 'eyebrow', 'raising', 'incident', 'took', 'place', 'back', '2010', 'one', 'oprahs', 'attention', 'grab', 'criminal', 'guise', 'spiritual', 'healer', 'anyway', 'oprah', 'attempt', 'salvage', 'reputation', 'expressing', 'empathy', 'towards', 'brave', 'women', 'came', 'forward', 'allegations', 'john', 'god', 'clear', 'involvement', 'already', 'left', 'indelible', 'mark', 'damage', 'done', 'sinister', 'connection', 'oprah', 'criminal', 'healer', 'would', 'forever', 'etched', 'annals', 'scandalous', 'history', 'bad', 'enough', 'already', 'oprah', 'winfreys', 'leadership', 'academy', 'girls', 'south', 'africa', 'always', 'hotbed', 'controversy']",1,fake,0.5651894277640322

Brace yourselves as Mel pulls back the curtain on the dark underbelly of Hollywood's elite, exposing their alleged involvement in the scandalous world of illicit human trade. And guess who's caught right in the middle of it? None other than the iconic Oprah Winfrey herself. So what exactly did Mel say? Our future is our children. Now the first step in eradicating this crime is awareness. In the glitzy world of Hollywood, where controversies and scandals are the talk of the town,
It's surprising how one particular movie has managed to fly under the radar.  Sound of Freedom, directed by Alejandro Gomez Monteverde,  delves deep into the dark underbelly of illegal human trade,  revealing the shocking methods employed by the elite to lure innocent victims into their sinister rings.  But what's even more intriguing is the lack of buzz, press coverage and endorsements surrounding this important film.
Why is a film starring a big actor, an established director and being promoted by Mel Gibson is not being shown in cinemas?

Many Thanks!!!",2023-07-17 23:18:44,Mel Gibson Exposes Oprah Winfrey's 'Questionable Action' for 'Hollywood Elites',"oprah opened them a hotbed of controversy stirring up whispers and skepticism from day one.  As soon as news broke about oprah's ambitious project the South African government wasted no time in expressing their disdain.  They criticized the exorbitant cost of the school  and questioned its relevance in a country plagued by poverty.  But did oprah let that deter her?  Not a chance.  With an air of grandiosity and a touch of arrogance she forged ahead
creating a glitzy institution that boasted luxurious salons and extravagant gyms.  And that's when the conspiracy theories began to take flight.  Whispers  spread like wildfire,  with many suggesting that the lavish school served as a front for something much darker,  illegal human trade.  The opulence and extravagance raised eyebrows and fueled suspicions that innocent young girls were being groomed for a life of exploitation. While no concrete evidence ever surfaced to support these scandalous claims,
It's impossible to deny that the whispers added a layer of intrigue and suspicion to the already controversial Academy.  But it didn't stop there.  Scandals and controversies soon plagued the institution,  exposing a dark and seedy underbelly that Oprah had fought so hard to keep hidden.  One shocking incident involved an employee named Virginia,  whose role involved overseeing the dormitories.  It was discovered that she had engaged in highly inappropriate conduct with not one
but multiple students between the ages of 13 and 15.  These vulnerable young girls, handpicked by Oprah herself,  fell victim to the very person entrusted with their care.  It was a stain on Oprah's reputation and a disturbing reflection of the Academy's inner workings.  Desperate to salvage her image and protect the brand she had built,  Oprah swooped in with a team of investigators to uncover the truth.
But the darkness didn't disow walls of Oprah's Academy. Disturbing revelations emerged, shedding light on a culture of violence and intimidation  among the students. It was revealed that a 15-year-old girl had been pressuring victims into silence,  coercing them not to report the physical altercations to their parents or authorities.  Shockingly,  seven students were suspended for their involvement in intimidating behavior and inappropriate acts.
Despite Oprah's attempts to address these issues,  it seemed that the problems were deeply ingrained within the Academy's very foundation.  Meanwhile,  fans have not been shy about expressing their disgust for the alleged actions of these Hollywood elites.  One fan commented,  she's a handler and I'm for this video folks, bye.

He's dishing the dirt on Whoopi's eyebrow raising controversies from jaw dropping statements to headline making feuds. Whoopi has been in the public spotlight many, many times, but perhaps none of her controversies so far have been as dramatic as Jason Aldean's latest lawsuit against her show. You know, so I think everybody was just kind of stunned and really didn't know what to do or what was going on or anything.
Who is Jason Aldean, you ask?  Jason Aldean's latest track, Try That in a Small Town, has stirred up quite a commotion since its music video dropped. Despite the song's initial May release,  it climbed to the none-too spot on the Billboard Hot 100 only after the music video hit the scene a few weeks ago.  In the video, we see protests and confrontations with the police,  sparking controversy. Nevertheless,
Despite all the attention and criticism, the song has defied expectations and secured its place on the charts, racking up an impressive 22 million views for the music video.  Aldean's lyrics don't mince words.  Cuss out a cop, spit in his face, stomp on the flag and light it up. Yeah, you think you're tough. We'll try that in a small town. See how far you make it down the road.  Around here, we take care of our own. You cross that line. It won't take long for you to find out. I recommend you don't.
This person pointed out the recent big fight in Alabama that went down and how Jason Aldean  kept catching heat from it. The way Jason Aldean is catching all the fucking strays with this Alabama situation is tickling me.  Another person tweeted about the situation saying,  this is what happens when you and your racist hillbilly buddies try that in a small town. Enjoy that a swap in.  And this person had a very hilarious take on the whole situation. Racist was the wrong word to describe that Jason Aldean track.
A better description for me is a, it's trash, don't bother.  Some people, however, couldn't see why the song was being called racist. I will leave this here for the people who claim this song is so called  racist.  It clearly talks about violent crimes and people in all color committing violent crimes.  There is nothing racist about this song  at Jason Aldean.  This person was also on the Jason Aldean bandwagon.  Apparently this song by Jason Aldean is racist.
Having listened to the song and watched the music video, I'm struggling to work out why. Any ideas why the woke left have lost it this time?

You know, is it racist? Do you think it's racism? I don't know.
Gather around folks, because Rosie O'Donnell just spilled some major tea during her jaw-dropping appearance on Brooke Shields' podcast, Now What?  If you thought daytime talk shows were all about camaraderie and discussions, think again.  Rosie didn't hold back one bit as she took a stroll down the memory lane of her tumultuous time on the iconic show, The View.  Taking a stroll down memory lane,
Rosie harked back to her entry into the daytime talk show in 2006.  She didn't hesitate to hint that the show's dynamics weren't exactly harmonious.  She didn't name names, but subtly indicated that Elizabeth Hasselbeck was a prominent player in the melodrama.  Moreover,  she hinted at a mysterious figure pulling the strings, referring to the show being less about women's voices and more about the directives of a certain white male CIS producer, the late Bill Getty.  But the real juicy bits were reserved for her interactions with the current host, Whoopi Goldberg.
Rosie's narrative took a turn as she revealed her initial exit  was a result of her clashes with Hasselbeck, but upon her return,  it was Whoopi who emerged as the thorn in her side.  These clashes weren't just everyday disagreements, they revolved around some pretty dark and controversial topics.
You don't have to be black to know what racism is. Yes, you do. No, you don't. Yes, you do, baby. you do not. Anyway, delving into the specifics of their disputes, Rosie dropped a bombshell. Apparently, Rosie and Whoopi's worlds collided over the essay case involving you-know-who, but that wasn't the only shocker. Rosie spilled that the view seemingly turned a blind eye to significant matters like the Rory Kennedy documentary about Abu Ghraib and the alleged US torture and even the essay allegations.
Rosie was taken aback when Whoopi flat out refused to discuss these matters on air, while the world watched the legal battle unfold.  The drama reached its pinnacle in 2007 when ABC decided to part ways with Rosie,  effectively ending her contract.  However, this incident wasn't the first time Rosie had aired her grievances against Whoopi.  She made waves in 2020 when she chatted with Howard Stern,  revealing that their relationship had been rocky from the very start.
Rosie humorously recounted an incident involving a commercial brake signal that Whoopi supposedly missed,  leading to tension right from day one.

Rosie didn't hold back one bit as she took a stroll down the memory lane of her tumultuous time on the iconic show the View. Taking a stroll down memory lane, Rosie harked back to her entry into the daytime Talk show in 2006. She didn't hesitate to hint that the show's dynamics weren't exactly harmonious. She didnt name names, but subtly indicated that Elizabeth Hasselbeck was a prominent player in the melodrama. Moreover, she hinted at a mysterious figure pulling the strings, referring to the show being less about womens voices and more about the directives of a certain white male CIS producer, the late Bill Getty. But the real juicy bits were reserved for her interactions with the current host, Whoopi Goldberg. Rosie's narrative took a turn as she revealed her initial exit was a result of her clashes with Hasselbeck. But upon her return, it was Whoopi who emerged as the thorn in her side. These clashes weren't just everyday disagreements, they revolved around some pretty dark and controversial topics. I have a black kid. I raise wy. I have a kid in my house that is not. You don't have to be black to know what racism is. Yes you do. No you don't. Yes you do. You do not. Anyway, delving into the specifics of their disputes, Rosie dropped a bombshell. Apparently, Rosie and Whoopi's worlds collided over the SA case involving you know who. But that wasn't the only shocker Rosie spilled that the View seemingly turned a blind eye to significant matters like the Rory Kennedy documentary about Abu Ghraib and the alleged US torture and even the SA allegations. Rosie was taken aback when Whoopi flat out refused to discuss these matters on air while the world watched the legal battle unfold. The drama reached its pinnacle in 2007 when ABC decided to part ways with Rosie, effectively ending her contract. However, this incident wasnt the first time Rosie had aired her grievances against Whoopi. She made waves in 2020 when she chatted with Howard Stern, revealing that their relationship had been rocky from the very start. Rosie humorously recounted an incident involving a commercial break signal that Whoopi supposedly missed, leading to tension right from day one.","['listen', 'white', 'lady', 'telling', 'racist', 'jay', 'american', 'whos', 'homophobia', 'hatred', 'looks', 'like', 'dont', 'think', 'itracist', 'somebody', 'turns', 'leader', 'free', 'country', 'says', 'park', 'car', 'know', 'racist', 'think', 'racism', 'dont', 'know', 'black', 'kid', 'rage', 'b', 'kid', 'house', 'dont', 'black', 'know', 'racism', 'yes', 'dont', 'yes', 'around', 'folks', 'ro', 'donll', 'spilled', 'major', 'tea', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'appearance', 'brookshields', 'podcast', 'thought', 'daytime', 'talk', 'shows', 'camaraderie', 'discussions', 'think', 'rosie', 'didnt', 'hold', 'back', 'one', 'bit', 'took', 'stroll', 'memory', 'lane', 'tumultuous', 'time', 'iconic', 'show', 'view', 'taking', 'stroll', 'memory', 'lane', 'rosie', 'harked', 'back', 'entry', 'daytime', 'talk', 'show', '2006', 'didnt', 'hesitate', 'hint', 'shows', 'dynamics', 'werent', 'exactly', 'harmonious', 'didnt', 'name', 'names', 'subtly', 'indicated', 'elizabeth', 'hasselbeck', 'prominent', 'player', 'melodrama', 'moreover', 'hinted', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'pulling', 'strings', 'referring', 'show', 'less', 'womens', 'voices', 'directives', 'certain', 'white', 'male', 'cis', 'producer', 'late', 'bill', 'getty', 'real', 'juicy', 'bits', 'reserved', 'interactions', 'current', 'host', 'whoopi', 'goldberg', 'rosies', 'narrative', 'took', 'turn', 'revealed', 'initial', 'exit', 'result', 'clashes', 'hasselbeck', 'upon', 'return', 'whoopi', 'emerged', 'thorn', 'side', 'clashes', 'werent', 'everyday', 'disagreements', 'revolved', 'around', 'pretty', 'dark', 'controversial', 'topics', 'black', 'kid', 'raise', 'wy', 'kid', 'house', 'dont', 'black', 'know', 'racism', 'yes', 'dont', 'yes', 'anyway', 'delving', 'specifics', 'disputes', 'rosie', 'dropped', 'bombshell', 'apparently', 'rosie', 'whoopis', 'worlds', 'collided', 'sa', 'case', 'involving', 'know', 'wasnt', 'shocker', 'rosie', 'spilled', 'view', 'seemingly', 'turned', 'blind', 'eye', 'significant', 'matters', 'like', 'rory', 'kennedy', 'documentary', 'abu', 'ghraib', 'alleged', 'us', 'torture', 'even', 'sa', 'allegations', 'rosie', 'taken', 'aback', 'whoopi', 'flat', 'refused', 'discuss', 'matters', 'air', 'world', 'watched', 'legal', 'battle', 'unfold', 'drama', 'reached', 'pinnacle', '2007', 'abc', 'decided', 'part', 'ways', 'rosie', 'effectively', 'ending', 'contract', 'however', 'incident', 'wasnt', 'first', 'time', 'rosie', 'aired', 'grievances', 'whoopi', 'made', 'waves', '2020', 'chatted', 'howard', 'stern', 'revealing', 'relationship', 'rocky', 'start', 'rosie', 'humorously', 'recounted', 'incident', 'involving', 'commercial', 'break', 'signal', 'whoopi', 'supposedly', 'missed', 'leading', 'tension', 'right', 'day', 'one']",1,fake,0.7029070059428171

The guy was like going like this. In the scandalous tell all book Ladies who Punched, the Explosive Story of the View, authored by Raman Satuta, Rosie spilled even more beans. She dished that Whoopi was anything but friendly. While they shared the stage, Rosie left no room for ambiguity, asserting that Whoopi's on air demeanor was in fact quote unquote mean as anyone has ever been on television to me personally. She confessed that even watching old clips with Whoopi made her see the negativity radiating from the screen. In an effort to set the record straight, Rosie made it clear during her chat with Stern that she wasnt seeking a feud with Whoopi. She simply aimed to share her side of the story. And as if this is not bad enough, Rosie also revealed that one of Whoopis close friends, Ellen DeGeneres, was also mean towards her. It all started with a bombshell of a falling out, the kind that had jaws dropping and heads turning. Ellen, known for her lovable Persona and witty humor, left Rosie flabbergasted when she declared to Larry King that she didnt know her and they werent friends. Say what? The fallout was like a juicy soap opera plot line unfolding right before our eyes here. And Ellen said, and Im'quoting I dont know Rosie were not friends. I was watching TV in bed with my wife going did she just say that? The Flintstones actress recently told an outlet it would never occur to me to say I dont know her about somebody whose babies I held when they were born. It wouldnt be in my lexicon of choices to ever say, but wait, it gets even juicier. Rosies story takes us down memory lane, back to a time when their friendship was seemingly intact. She reminisced about a time when she held Ellens babies when they were fresh out of the oven, a heartwarming gesture that would make anyone believe in the power of camaraderie. Yet beneath the surface of this seemingly rock solid friendship, a storm was brewing. Rosie confessed to feeling a sense of solidarity when Ellen courageously came out as a lesbian, a pivotal moment that should have cemented their bond. But oh, how the tides turned when Rosie found herself navigating the treacherous waters of media scrutiny. Ellen, who held the spotlight as the queen of daytime television, seemed to have a change of heart, leaving Rosie high and dry when she needed her most. Now heres where things take a curious twist. Rosie revealed that Ellen recently slid into her DMs. Well, not exactly, but you get the picture. A few weeks back I got this text from Ellen checking in on me and all that Rosie revealed, her words dripping with intrigue. Its as if the spotlight was once again shining on their relationship, revealing a dynamic that'more enigmatic than meets the eye.","['day', 'one', 'upset', 'like', 'threw', 'commercial', 'didnt', 'know', 'saw', 'countdown', 'guy', 'like', 'going', 'like', 'scandalous', 'tell', 'book', 'ladies', 'punched', 'explosive', 'story', 'view', 'authored', 'raman', 'satuta', 'rosie', 'spilled', 'even', 'beans', 'dished', 'whoopi', 'anything', 'friendly', 'shared', 'stage', 'rosie', 'left', 'room', 'ambiguity', 'asserting', 'whoopis', 'air', 'demeanor', 'fact', 'quote', 'unquote', 'mean', 'anyone', 'ever', 'television', 'personally', 'confessed', 'even', 'watching', 'old', 'clips', 'whoopi', 'made', 'see', 'negativity', 'radiating', 'screen', 'effort', 'set', 'record', 'straight', 'rosie', 'made', 'clear', 'chat', 'stern', 'wasnt', 'seeking', 'feud', 'whoopi', 'simply', 'aimed', 'share', 'side', 'story', 'bad', 'enough', 'rosie', 'also', 'revealed', 'one', 'whoopis', 'close', 'friends', 'ellen', 'degeneres', 'also', 'mean', 'towards', 'started', 'bombshell', 'falling', 'kind', 'jaws', 'dropping', 'heads', 'turning', 'ellen', 'known', 'lovable', 'persona', 'witty', 'humor', 'left', 'rosie', 'flabbergasted', 'declared', 'larry', 'king', 'didnt', 'know', 'werent', 'friends', 'say', 'fallout', 'like', 'juicy', 'soap', 'opera', 'plot', 'line', 'unfolding', 'right', 'eyes', 'ellen', 'said', 'imquoting', 'dont', 'know', 'rosie', 'friends', 'watching', 'tv', 'bed', 'wife', 'going', 'say', 'flintstones', 'actress', 'recently', 'told', 'outlet', 'would', 'never', 'occur', 'say', 'dont', 'know', 'somebody', 'whose', 'babies', 'held', 'born', 'wouldnt', 'lexicon', 'choices', 'ever', 'say', 'wait', 'gets', 'even', 'juicier', 'rosies', 'story', 'takes', 'us', 'memory', 'lane', 'back', 'time', 'friendship', 'seemingly', 'intact', 'reminisced', 'time', 'held', 'ellens', 'babies', 'fresh', 'oven', 'heartwarming', 'gesture', 'would', 'make', 'anyone', 'believe', 'power', 'camaraderie', 'yet', 'beneath', 'surface', 'seemingly', 'rock', 'solid', 'friendship', 'storm', 'brewing', 'rosie', 'confessed', 'feeling', 'sense', 'solidarity', 'ellen', 'courageously', 'came', 'lesbian', 'pivotal', 'moment', 'cemented', 'bond', 'oh', 'tides', 'turned', 'rosie', 'found', 'navigating', 'treacherous', 'waters', 'media', 'scrutiny', 'ellen', 'held', 'spotlight', 'queen', 'daytime', 'television', 'seemed', 'change', 'heart', 'leaving', 'rosie', 'high', 'dry', 'needed', 'heres', 'things', 'take', 'curious', 'twist', 'rosie', 'revealed', 'ellen', 'recently', 'slid', 'dms', 'well', 'exactly', 'get', 'picture', 'weeks', 'back', 'got', 'text', 'ellen', 'checking', 'rosie', 'revealed', 'words', 'dripping', 'intrigue', 'spotlight', 'shining', 'relationship', 'revealing', 'dynamic', 'thatmore', 'enigmatic', 'meets', 'eye']",1,fake,0.5796372690036958

Yeah, a judge struck down his motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Thonny Willis's investigation into him and his allies and their alleged interference in Georgia's last presidential election. So Brooks Baptiste has details about this this morning. Hey guys, so we have officially entered that window and time in which District Attorney Fonnie Willis's office may drop an indictment against the former president for his role in the 2020 election here in Georgia.
Right now, all surrounding law enforcement agencies are ready in the event things turn ugly. They are prepared for potential outcry or violence here in the city  in response to that possible indictment. Now this past weekend we need to tell you that the DA says she received a disturbing email calling her a number of racial slurs, whereas that we can't even repeat here on air.  Well, Willis said.
that she sent that message out along with a warning to local officials to remind them that this level of hatred and pushback is what she's facing right now. And she said that notes like these to her office during this two and a half year long investigation were  not very unique and in fact pretty typical. So of course we're going to be sure to alert you if an indictment comes down. Be sure to download our free Atlanta News First app guys.

Meanwhile, on Monday,  August 21st, almost a fortnight after the devastating fires in Lahaina, classes resumed. However,  one in four children are still missing from nearly every grade in almost every school. And for some, their schools were completely burned down, which is why almost 3,357 students will have to be relocated to different schools in other lesser affected parts of the island of Maui.  So far,
Only 400 of them have re-enrolled to other schools, while 200 opted for distance learning. However, it still remains unknown how many students have relocated, enrolled elsewhere, or are no longer alive. While keeping in mind that there is usually some truth in a bunch of stories, something must have happened that caused such many conciparacies to appear. A fan on Twitter said Oprah's land in upcountry near Kula has a huge underground facility with tons of concrete she has been building it for years.
Tom Hanks is reported to own a home in Maui also, along with Steven Tyler, Lars Ulrich, and Woody Harrelson. Or it's just a coincidence. Another said, would be great if people like Oprah, Jeff Bezos, Tom Hanks, and other wealthy landowners give some of their land back to the native and locals of Hawaii, Lahaina, Maui, so they can rebuild their lives and communities. That would be the humanitarian thing to do. Maui fire. What's your take on what's going on in Maui? Were the elites involved? Was it just nature? Tell us in the comment section.

The man continues.  It's almost like they're resetting something to start rebuilding for this.  Some suggest the United States military set off the blaze  or that it was part of an elite land grab, possibly spearheaded by Oprah Winfrey herself. Some of the theories also tap into legitimate complaints from the grieving and the displaced about the lack of warning they received  despite the threat from wildfires being well documented by Maui County officials.
The cause of Maui's wildfires remains under investigation, but officials say that wind gusts whipped up by Hurricane Dora combined with severe drought conditions on West Maui are to blame. Wildfires have been a known risk in the area for years. While other media users were talking about elites targeting the land, others have uncovered another theory where they claim that blue items along the fire were not touched.
And you guys know who allegedly owns that right there.  Man, that's just sad though. Even if just thinking about somebody would start a fire like that and knowing that people was there and a lot of people lost their life and stuff. And then you got all these business coming out  ready to just buy the land.  And like I said, that's why a lot of people was mad at the Oprah situation because they're like, you're trying to go out and buy this land just for your own profit, just so you can make money.
And  stuff like that just makes you so mad. Like I said, I'm gonna keep saying it once again, My heart, my prayers go out to everybody in Maui, man. It was unfortunate. Something like this just really, really, really just bothers me, just really hurts me, man. A lot of people lost their life.

To be accountable and stand up to the mistakes you've made.” , “The Rock is allegedly in panic after the alleged truth about his donation has just been leaked. And guess who is rumored to have accidentally spilled the beans? None other than his supposed partner in crime, Winfrey.” , “Dwayne and I put in $10 million to start the fund. We want to continue for as long as we can.” , “So what exactly is going on? In a jaw dropping turn of events that sent shockwaves through the world of celebrity philanthropy, it seems that the ever charming Dwayne Johnson and the queen of talk shows herself, Oprah Winfrey, might not be the altruistic saviors we thought they were.
What initially looked like a generous $10 million donation to help the people of Maui is now being seen in a whole new light with rumors and whispers swirling about the true motives behind this flashy act of charity. Just a few days ago, social media was buzzing with excitement as Dwayne Johnson and Oprah Winfrey made headlines by announcing their jaw dropping donation of $10 million to aid the victims of Maui.” , “That money is going to go to one of many residents who have been displaced in Maui, we guarantee.” , “The news spread like wildfire, tugging at heartstrings and winning these celebrities a heap of praise from their adoring fans.
However, as the days rolled on, it became painfully clear that the reality of their supposed charitable endeavor wasn't quite what it seemed. Oprah, in an exclusive interview that only added more fuel to the gossip mill tried to explain that the $10 million wasn't going directly to the people of Maui, as most had naively assumed. Instead, Johnson and Winfrey had decided to set up something they called the People's Fund of Maui.” , “Dwayne and I put in $10 million to start the fund. We want to continue for as long as we can.” , “Well, that raised more than a few perfectly manicured eyebrows and left us all wondering what's really going on here.
Defending their decision, Oprah eloquently stated, the infrastructure is in place for your donations to help people be able to have their own money, have their own agency.”","['video', 'shows', 'dwayne', 'rock', 'johnson', 'reporter', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'saying', 'rock', 'afraid', 'absolutely', 'everything', 'accountable', 'stand', 'mistakes', 'youve', 'made', 'rock', 'allegedly', 'panic', 'alleged', 'truth', 'donation', 'leaked', 'guess', 'rumored', 'accidentally', 'spilled', 'beans', 'none', 'supposed', 'partner', 'crime', 'winfrey', 'dwayne', 'put', '10', 'million', 'start', 'fund', 'want', 'continue', 'long', 'exactly', 'going', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'turn', 'events', 'sent', 'shockwaves', 'world', 'celebrity', 'philanthropy', 'seems', 'ever', 'charming', 'dwayne', 'johnson', 'queen', 'talk', 'shows', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'might', 'altruistic', 'saviors', 'thought', 'initially', 'looked', 'like', 'generous', '10', 'million', 'donation', 'help', 'people', 'maui', 'seen', 'whole', 'new', 'light', 'rumors', 'whispers', 'swirling', 'true', 'motives', 'behind', 'flashy', 'act', 'charity', 'days', 'ago', 'social', 'media', 'buzzing', 'excitement', 'dwayne', 'johnson', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'made', 'headlines', 'announcing', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'donation', '10', 'million', 'aid', 'victims', 'maui', 'money', 'going', 'go', 'one', 'many', 'residents', 'displaced', 'maui', 'guarantee', 'news', 'spread', 'like', 'wildfire', 'tugging', 'heartstrings', 'winning', 'celebrities', 'heap', 'praise', 'adoring', 'fans', 'however', 'days', 'rolled', 'became', 'painfully', 'clear', 'reality', 'supposed', 'charitable', 'endeavor', 'wasnt', 'quite', 'seemed', 'oprah', 'exclusive', 'interview', 'added', 'fuel', 'gossip', 'mill', 'tried', 'explain', '10', 'million', 'wasnt', 'going', 'directly', 'people', 'maui', 'naively', 'assumed', 'instead', 'johnson', 'winfrey', 'decided', 'set', 'something', 'called', 'peoples', 'fund', 'maui', 'dwayne', 'put', '10', 'million', 'start', 'fund', 'want', 'continue', 'long', 'well', 'raised', 'perfectly', 'manicured', 'eyebrows', 'left', 'us', 'wondering', 'whats', 'really', 'going', 'defending', 'decision', 'oprah', 'eloquently', 'stated', 'infrastructure', 'place', 'donations', 'help', 'people', 'able', 'money', 'agency']",1,fake,0.5229541170456972

There had actually been a news article on celebrities painting their houses a weird shade of blue and now the public is speculating that they must have planned everything ahead of time. While others are questioning the fires over land, others are claiming that the elites wanted something more than just land. They wanted something that they could not get without the fire.
and that is the children. This conspiracists are alleging that since most of the people who have yet to be found in the fires are children, those children might have been taken. In a deeply concerning development, the Hawaii State Department of Education has reported that 2,025 students remain unaccounted for in the Lahaina public school system following the devastating fire on August 8th in Lahaina, Maui. This has made the public question why some kids were at school while others were home.
But it seems that the fire coincided with the first day back at school for many students. Schools had been closed due to an outage, leaving many children home alone. The tragedy has ignited a firestorm of criticism directed at Hawaii's state government, particularly Governor Josh Green, for perceived inadequacies in emergency response and preparedness. The absence of warning sirens and a perceived lack of an official response to the disaster have drawn widespread condemnation.
While the cause of the fires hasn't been determined, Hawaiian Electric, the major power company on Maui, is under scrutiny for not shutting down power lines when high winds created dangerous fire conditions. Hawaiian Electric previously said both the company and the state are conducting investigations into what happened. Meanwhile, the conspiracy theories have become so widespread that Hawaiian officials have addressed them with the office of Governor Josh Green saying in a statement,
There is no truth to the horrendous assertion that the fires were deliberately set to raise the historic town of Lahaina,  which was the first capital of the Hawaiian kingdom.  But who knows, there has to be some truth they could tell instead of trying to keep everything secret.  A fan on Twitter said, Oprah's land in upcountry near Kula has a huge underground facility with tones of concrete. She has been building it for years.  Tom Hanks is reported to own a home in Maui also.
along with Steven Tyler, Lars Ulrich, and Woody Harrelson. Or it's just a coincidence. Another said, Everyone including Tom Hanks, who had their Maui house painted blue, was in on this hit job. They knew it was coming. They had foreknowledge, which is a big issue in illegal action. So what's your take on Tom Hanks and his role in the Maui fires? Tell us in the comment section.

But wait, it gets even juicier.  Brace yourselves for the big reveal. The People's Fund of Maui, it turns out, is owned and operated by the Entertainment Industry Foundation, EIF, a nonprofit organization with close ties to, you guessed it, the entertainment industry. That's right, folks.
The charity we all thought was going to help the needy citizens of Maui is actually in bed with the Hollywood elite. Once this bombshell was dropped, the rumor mill went into overdrive and questions about transparency and ethics started flooding in. But here's where it gets really scandalous.  The fat cat executives over at EIF seem to be living the high life while the rest of us are left wondering where the alleged $10 million went.  In fact, some people are convinced that the donations made to the People's Fund of Maui might not even get to the intended recipients.
You see, reports came crashing down, revealing that the president of EIF is raking in a hefty salary north of $400,000 a year. The CEO isn't far behind, pocketing over $300,000 annually. And let's not forget the CFO, casually stashing away more than $290,000 each year, not to mention the 29 other individuals on EIF's payroll who are laughing all the way to the bank with salaries exceeding $100,000 each year.
These 13 top tier executives are collectively rolling in a mind boggling $3.2 million. While the lower level workers, the ones actually doing the charities heavy lifting, are left to scrape by on an average of approximately $64,527 per year.  Now, if that doesn't make you shake your head in disbelief, I don't know what will. The glaring disconnect between EIF's lavish executive salaries and the paltry $1,200  being doled out to those in need through the People's Fund of Maui,
is enough to make anyone's blood boil.  It's no wonder the public has begun to wonder whether Dwayne and Oprah's supposed act of charity was nothing more than a slick publicity stunt designed to keep them in the spotlight.  Critics argue that the real winners in this scheme are the executives running EIF,  while the victims of the Hawaii wildfire are left high and dry.  As the scandal continues to unfold, it's prompted a broader conversation about the true nature of nonprofit organizations.
especially those with executives living the high life on donors' hard-earned cash.  Are these organizations genuinely committed to supporting those in need,  or are they just elaborate schemes to further line the pockets of the rich and famous?  In the midst of this growing controversy, some outspoken advocates are encouraging individuals to sidestep the shady dealings of celebrity-backed nonprofits  and donate directly to those in need through independent platforms.
After all, by cutting out the middle man, you can ensure your donations land where they belong without any detours through the bank accounts of celebrity endorsed charities. In any case, Oprah and Dwayne both

Following the Maui wildfires, which left 115 people dead just a few weeks ago, Oprah Winfrey and Dwayne The Rock Johnson came forward and launched the People's Fund of Maui, allegedly providing direct financial assistance to victims of the wildfires. 

The two mega-billionaires asked people to donate as much as they could to the fund. However, rumors that this fund might be a scam have started floating around. What does Oprah have to do with the Maui wildfires? 

And is she really trying to steal donation money to buy more land in Maui? Let's find out. I'm completely heartbroken over this, and I know all of you are too. Everything that I've seen transpire over these past couple of days, everything that continues to transpire hour by hour and minute by minute, it's all heartbreaking. 

The Maui wildfires were responsible for 115 confirmed deaths back in August. And with more than 300 people still missing, these fires are turning out to be the worst natural disaster in the history of Hawaii. 

The Maui wildfires destroyed Hawaii to the point of a national emergency and left thousands of people without a place to live. In the middle of all this chaos, it was revealed that Oprah owned more than 2,000 acres of land in Maui. 

Oprah owning this much land in a native Hawaiian area received mostly negative reactions from people as everyone thought it was weird for Oprah to own land, knowing it might lead to the displacement of the native people. 

Soon after this was revealed, Oprah launched a campaign to collect donations for the people of Maui. A lot of people felt that Oprah was doing this because","['looks', 'like', 'keanu', 'reeves', 'finally', 'speaking', 'hollywood', 'elites', 'like', 'oprah', 'dwayne', 'rock', 'johnson', 'trying', 'use', 'maui', 'fires', 'scam', 'people', 'donation', 'money', 'youre', 'going', 'believe', 'say', 'concerned', 'happening', 'maui', 'texting', 'back', 'forth', 'read', 'article', 'dolly', 'parton', 'given', 'money', 'community', 'said', 'think', 'answer', 'said', 'think', 'thats', 'answer', 'said', 'love', 'created', 'peoples', 'fund', 'maui', 'following', 'maui', 'wildfires', 'left', '115', 'people', 'dead', 'weeks', 'ago', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'dwayne', 'rock', 'johnson', 'came', 'forward', 'launched', 'peoples', 'fund', 'maui', 'allegedly', 'providing', 'direct', 'financial', 'assistance', 'victims', 'wildfires', 'two', 'megabillionaires', 'asked', 'people', 'donate', 'much', 'could', 'fund', 'however', 'rumors', 'fund', 'might', 'scam', 'started', 'floating', 'around', 'oprah', 'maui', 'wildfires', 'really', 'trying', 'steal', 'donation', 'money', 'buy', 'land', 'maui', 'lets', 'find', 'im', 'completely', 'heartbroken', 'know', 'everything', 'ive', 'seen', 'transpire', 'past', 'couple', 'days', 'everything', 'continues', 'transpire', 'hour', 'hour', 'minute', 'minute', 'heartbreaking', 'maui', 'wildfires', 'responsible', '115', 'confirmed', 'deaths', 'back', 'august', '300', 'people', 'still', 'missing', 'fires', 'turning', 'worst', 'natural', 'disaster', 'history', 'hawaii', 'maui', 'wildfires', 'destroyed', 'hawaii', 'point', 'national', 'emergency', 'left', 'thousands', 'people', 'without', 'place', 'live', 'middle', 'chaos', 'revealed', 'oprah', 'owned', '2000', 'acres', 'land', 'maui', 'oprah', 'owning', 'much', 'land', 'native', 'hawaiian', 'area', 'received', 'mostly', 'negative', 'reactions', 'people', 'everyone', 'thought', 'weird', 'oprah', 'land', 'knowing', 'might', 'lead', 'displacement', 'native', 'people', 'soon', 'revealed', 'oprah', 'launched', 'campaign', 'collect', 'donations', 'people', 'maui', 'lot', 'people', 'felt', 'oprah']",1,fake,0.5868436126083912

I just want to remind all you real estate  investors around the world like that Lahaina is not for sale.  Please don't reach out to these families and take advantage of them during the most devastating time of our lives.  If I don't make it through this,  I love everybody. In recent days, Oprah Winfrey has been facing a series of significant developments that hint at a hidden narrative unfolding beneath the surface. Adding to these revelations, Tom Hanks has stepped forward to shed light on Oprah's genuine motivations and the undisclosed agenda behind the Maui fires. The information is quite astonishing, so prepare yourself as we delve into the details in the following video. The human impact and the economic toll of the Maui fires continues to unfold. The state estimates losing $11 million a day. Speculation has arisen about a potential connection between Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey in regards to questionable activities transpiring in Maui. As the residents of Maui wake up to yet another day of devastation caused by the devastating wildfire, which has tragically claimed lives and displaced hundreds of people, there is a growing curiosity about the wealthiest landowners on the island and their conspicuous silence in the midst of this crisis. However, Tom Hanks' recent statements are clarifying that he has never been involved with Oprah in any such heinous activities. Instead, he has come forward to reveal her intentions concerning the land in Maui.  I looked at that debris.  I looked at all those burnt cars. ah I can  smell what I'm smelling.  You I think we want to make sure that we do this. As the devastating flames engulfed a five-square-mile area, claiming at least 106 lives, some voices on the internet have ventured into the realm of the bizarre. They suggest that influential figures, including Winfrey, who owns valuable property on the island, might have somehow orchestrated the inferno to further their mysterious agendas. Several TikTok users have raised suspicions, pointing fingers at billionaires like Winfrey. They allege that the fires are part of a supposed plot to obtain valuable land in Maui from indigenous communities. This conspiracy theory has arisen due to the belief that the celebrity acquired a substantial 2,000-acre parcel on the island in March 2023. After 2017, Oprah  continued expanding her land  in Montecito to over 70 acres, including buying a  A4  land. Moreover, some powerful figures rumored association with Maui's properties has led to a dramatic surge in property prices.","['see', 'entire', 'families', 'whove', 'lost', 'every', 'single', 'thing', 'theyre', 'living', 'air', 'mattress', 'cot', 'chair', 'want', 'remind', 'real', 'estate', 'investors', 'around', 'world', 'like', 'lahaina', 'sale', 'please', 'dont', 'reach', 'families', 'take', 'advantage', 'devastating', 'time', 'lives', 'dont', 'make', 'love', 'everybody', 'recent', 'days', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'facing', 'series', 'significant', 'developments', 'hint', 'hidden', 'narrative', 'unfolding', 'beneath', 'surface', 'adding', 'revelations', 'tom', 'hanks', 'stepped', 'forward', 'shed', 'light', 'oprahs', 'genuine', 'motivations', 'undisclosed', 'agenda', 'behind', 'maui', 'fires', 'information', 'quite', 'astonishing', 'prepare', 'delve', 'details', 'following', 'video', 'human', 'impact', 'economic', 'toll', 'maui', 'fires', 'continues', 'unfold', 'state', 'estimates', 'losing', '11', 'million', 'day', 'speculation', 'arisen', 'potential', 'connection', 'tom', 'hanks', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'regards', 'questionable', 'activities', 'transpiring', 'maui', 'residents', 'maui', 'wake', 'yet', 'another', 'day', 'devastation', 'caused', 'devastating', 'wildfire', 'tragically', 'claimed', 'lives', 'displaced', 'hundreds', 'people', 'growing', 'curiosity', 'wealthiest', 'landowners', 'island', 'conspicuous', 'silence', 'midst', 'crisis', 'however', 'tom', 'hanks', 'recent', 'statements', 'clarifying', 'never', 'involved', 'oprah', 'heinous', 'activities', 'instead', 'come', 'forward', 'reveal', 'intentions', 'concerning', 'land', 'maui', 'looked', 'debris', 'looked', 'burnt', 'cars', 'ah', 'smell', 'im', 'smelling', 'think', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'devastating', 'flames', 'engulfed', 'fivesquaremile', 'area', 'claiming', 'least', '106', 'lives', 'voices', 'internet', 'ventured', 'realm', 'bizarre', 'suggest', 'influential', 'figures', 'including', 'winfrey', 'owns', 'valuable', 'property', 'island', 'might', 'somehow', 'orchestrated', 'inferno', 'mysterious', 'agendas', 'several', 'tiktok', 'users', 'raised', 'suspicions', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'billionaires', 'like', 'winfrey', 'allege', 'fires', 'part', 'supposed', 'plot', 'obtain', 'valuable', 'land', 'maui', 'indigenous', 'communities', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'arisen', 'due', 'belief', 'celebrity', 'acquired', 'substantial', '2000acre', 'parcel', 'island', 'march', '2023', '2017', 'oprah', 'continued', 'expanding', 'land', 'montecito', '70', 'acres', 'including', 'buying', 'a4', 'land', 'moreover', 'powerful', 'figures', 'rumored', 'association', 'mauis', 'properties', 'led', 'dramatic', 'surge', 'property', 'prices']",1,fake,0.6968196998956345

Been holding onto this for too long, Hanks tweeted, attaching a series of documents and photos seemingly indicating questionable land dealings. Oprah's real estate game in Maui isn't about paradise. It's about profit at the cost of the locals. While the documents are yet to be verified,
The claims have already sent shockwaves across the entertainment industry. The alleged plan suggests the acquisition of vast expanses of land, possibly displacing local communities in favor of luxury resorts and private estates. Fans of both stars are in disarray, with some praising Hanks for speaking out while others caution patients, suggesting more clarity is needed before passing judgment. Representatives for Oprah Winfrey have been quick to label the allegations as baseless and defamatory, promising a more detailed statement soon. Meanwhile, legal experts are dissecting the documents shared by Hanks.
aiming to determine their authenticity. As Hollywood grapples with this latest controversy, all eyes are on Maui, awaiting further developments in this unfolding saga. A day after Tom Hanks' startling claims about Oprah Winfrey's alleged controversial land deals in Maui, Hawaii, Oprah has broken her silence. In a press conference held earlier today, the media mogul addressed the allegations head on, providing context and presenting her side of the story.
Expressing her disappointment over the way the information was presented, she went on to detail her plans, which, contrary to Hanks' claims, reportedly involve sustainable tourism and collaboration with local communities. She also mentioned an initiative to provide scholarships to Maui's youth, aiming to ensure they benefit directly from any developments. The response from the public has been mixed.
While some fans are relieved and express their trust in Oprah's intentions, others argue that the controversy has highlighted broader concerns about large-scale land acquisitions in sensitive areas. Tom Hanks has yet to respond to Oprah's clarifications. Given the magnitude of the claims and the reputation of both Hollywood giants, this story is far from over. The entertainment industry and fans worldwide are eagerly awaiting further developments.

He ventured into the murky waters of Tinseltown, shining a spotlight on some eyebrow-raising connections and interactions that have left many tongues wagging. So he'd say, hey, you s***, I'm going to make you a star. And you would actually do it. One of the biggest bombshells Rogan dropped was the alleged involvement of male actors, including the high-profile Matt Damon, in what he suggests might be a bit more than just professional networking. According to Rogan, these actors, in their quest for stardom, might have taken some unconventional routes. He had it set up  where this was how you got by. This is how you made movies. This is how you want to be famous.  This is how you get famous. In the podcast episode, Joe Rogan delved into the deeply unsettling and controversial revelations surrounding Harvey Weinstein and the pervasive culture of exploitation within the entertainment industry.  He would actually give them the things he would tell them he would give them.So he'd say, hey, you say I'm going to make you a star. The fall from grace of Harvey Weinstein was a watershed moment in the entertainment world. One of the most disturbing aspects of Weinstein's alleged actions, as discussed by Rogan, was his sinister modus operandi. According to Whitney Cummings, a prominent comedian and actress, Weinstein had a disturbing pattern of behavior. He would allegedly make grandiose promises to young and aspiring actors. But these promises came with a horrifying condition. So they would get all this treatment and then they had to spend some alone time with them every now and then. At the core of Weinstein's manipulation, as detailed by Rogan, was a disturbing quid pro quo scenario.  He purportedly told these aspiring actors that if they engaged in  s*** with him, they would be rewarded with the coveted opportunity to become stars in his movies.  However,  once an actor had acquiesced to his demands, they were subjected to further exploitation. In addition to that, Rogan also revealed that Weinstein would shower these individuals with attention and privileges,  effectively keeping them under his control.  However, this lavish treatment came at a price as Weinstein expected these actors to spend even more intimate and private time with him.  It was a chilling cycle of manipulation and exploitation that left these actors feeling trapped.  What's more, to maintain the illusion of genuine affection,  Rogan asserted that Weinstein would encourage these actors to send him affectionate and even romantic emails. These messages, on the surface, seem to reflect a loving relationship,  but in reality, the actors harbored deep resentment towards Weinstein for the compromising situations they found themselves in. uh","['filter', 'approach', 'always', 'made', 'compelling', 'content', 'time', 'different', 'ventured', 'murky', 'waters', 'tinseltown', 'shining', 'spotlight', 'eyebrowraising', 'connections', 'interactions', 'left', 'many', 'tongues', 'wagging', 'hed', 'say', 'hey', 'im', 'going', 'make', 'star', 'would', 'actually', 'one', 'biggest', 'bombshells', 'rogan', 'dropped', 'alleged', 'involvement', 'male', 'actors', 'including', 'highprofile', 'matt', 'damon', 'suggests', 'might', 'bit', 'professional', 'networking', 'according', 'rogan', 'actors', 'quest', 'stardom', 'might', 'taken', 'unconventional', 'routes', 'set', 'got', 'made', 'movies', 'want', 'famous', 'get', 'famous', 'podcast', 'episode', 'joe', 'rogan', 'delved', 'deeply', 'unsettling', 'controversial', 'revelations', 'surrounding', 'harvey', 'weinstein', 'pervasive', 'culture', 'exploitation', 'within', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'would', 'actually', 'give', 'things', 'would', 'tell', 'would', 'give', 'themso', 'hed', 'say', 'hey', 'say', 'im', 'going', 'make', 'star', 'fall', 'grace', 'harvey', 'weinstein', 'watershed', 'moment', 'entertainment', 'world', 'one', 'disturbing', 'aspects', 'weinsteins', 'alleged', 'actions', 'discussed', 'rogan', 'sinister', 'modus', 'operandi', 'according', 'whitney', 'cummings', 'prominent', 'comedian', 'actress', 'weinstein', 'disturbing', 'pattern', 'behavior', 'would', 'allegedly', 'make', 'grandiose', 'promises', 'young', 'aspiring', 'actors', 'promises', 'came', 'horrifying', 'condition', 'would', 'get', 'treatment', 'spend', 'alone', 'time', 'every', 'core', 'weinsteins', 'manipulation', 'detailed', 'rogan', 'disturbing', 'quid', 'pro', 'quo', 'scenario', 'purportedly', 'told', 'aspiring', 'actors', 'engaged', 'would', 'rewarded', 'coveted', 'opportunity', 'become', 'stars', 'movies', 'however', 'actor', 'acquiesced', 'demands', 'subjected', 'exploitation', 'addition', 'rogan', 'also', 'revealed', 'weinstein', 'would', 'shower', 'individuals', 'attention', 'privileges', 'effectively', 'keeping', 'control', 'however', 'lavish', 'treatment', 'came', 'price', 'weinstein', 'expected', 'actors', 'spend', 'even', 'intimate', 'private', 'time', 'chilling', 'cycle', 'manipulation', 'exploitation', 'left', 'actors', 'feeling', 'trapped', 'whats', 'maintain', 'illusion', 'genuine', 'affection', 'rogan', 'asserted', 'weinstein', 'would', 'encourage', 'actors', 'send', 'affectionate', 'even', 'romantic', 'emails', 'messages', 'surface', 'seem', 'reflect', 'loving', 'relationship', 'reality', 'actors', 'harbored', 'deep', 'resentment', 'towards', 'weinstein', 'compromising', 'situations', 'found', 'uh']",1,fake,0.5415632039516322

Waxman said her piece revolved around an executive at the Italian branch of Miramax who had supposedly been paid just to facilitate Weinstein's essay.  She added, after intense pressure from Weinstein, which included having Matt Damon and Russell Crowe call me directly to vouch for Lombardo and unknown discussions well above my head at the Times, the story was gutted.  I was told at the time that Weinstein had visited the newsroom in person to make his displeasure known.  I knew he was a major advertiser in the Times and that he was a powerful person overall. In response, Damon said he had no knowledge about the subject of Waxman's story. He said Weinstein only told him that the paper was doing a hit job on Lombardo.  Harvey said Sharon Waxman is writing a story about Fabrizio and it's really negative. Can you just call and tell her what your experience with Fabrizio was?  So I did and that's what I said to her.  It didn't even make the piece that she wrote.  As I recall, her piece just said that Russell and I had called and relayed our experience with Fabrizio, he said. Meanwhile, fans have not shied away from expressing their thoughts concerning Matt Damon's alleged allegiance to Weinstein.  One particular person wrote,  I wouldn't say Matt Damon is a bad guy necessarily, but he looks out for himself.  He's been friends and connected to a lot of horrible people, but doesn't say anything or says he didn't know. He stays in his lane to the point of letting horrible stuff happen.  A second person talked about the risks that came with exposing the Hollywood elite. They said, Let's be honest, if Matt Damon or Ben Affleck would have spoken up at the time this happened, they probably would have been erased from Hollywood.  In any case, Rogan's hypothesis invites us to contemplate the experiences of other male actors who may have been coerced, manipulated,  or pressured into engaging in relationships  or exchanges that challenge their personal boundaries.  While it is crucial to remember that these assertions remain speculative,  they underscore the need for a more comprehensive dialogue surrounding the ab****d power and coercion within the film industry.  Joe Rogan's willingness to explore these uncomfortable and contentious topics  serves as a reminder that the issue goes beyond gender lines.  It raises questions about the ethical boundaries actors are willing to cross  in their pursuit of fame and the role of power dynamics in shaping the trajectories of their careers.  Anyway, that's it for this video, folks.

Just a few months after their beautiful union, they made their first red carpet appearance as a married couple at the 2009 Met Gala. The world got to witness their radiant newlywed happiness, captured in smiles and intertwined hands.  In March 2015, Emma was by Bruce's side to celebrate a significant milestone.
his 60th birthday.  The event was a star-studded affair,  a testament to the many lives Bruce had touched in his six decades.  Adding to their joy and love on April 1st, 2012, they welcomed their first child together, a baby girl named Mabel Ray Willis. It was a moment of pure happiness as their family expanded.  Their family grew once more on May 5th, 2014,  as they welcomed their second daughter, Evelyn Penn Willis, into the world.

To Bruce's amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues  and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities.

AFTD, who shed light on the nature of the disease. What we know is, obviously, the disease can start in the frontal or the temporal lobes, like the name signifies. One of the things that the frontal lobe controls is self-insight. We don't know. Some people, that's the first thing they lose. Any understanding that they themselves have changed and other people retain that for a long time, she explained.

On the show, the comedian reflected on a clip from the Golden Globes where the professional was making jokes,  using his humor to entertain the people while suggesting that Tom Hanks disapproved of the content of his jokes. You might be wondering if it was the first time Ricky hosted the show, as the audience members might not have liked the jokes. Well, no.  The host has hosted the ceremony several times.
He is specifically known for his no holds barred opening monologues.  His comedy focuses on the celebrities sitting before him during the event. The comedian explained an anecdote where he told the podcast host that people did not like his jokes at first, including Tom Hanks. And they said that it was his arrogance to make the jokes. He said,  the big meme was Tom Hanks going, why is he saying that? And people are going,  oh look, he's on his high horse.
People tend to follow their leaders or other humans who are more famous or more skilled or are in a better position than themselves. Likewise, in Hollywood, one such personality is Leonardo DiCaprio. It should be of no surprise that the same audience who was first mocking the comedian for his humor started applauding it as soon as DiCaprio started to laugh at the host's jokes. Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere and by the end, his date was too old for him.
The artist then further signified the need for an audience for a comedian who can take jokes and will not get offended by the humor. Stand-up shows are often only crowd works. Similarly, in the award shows, the celebrities can be joked about individually. For Ricky Gervais, people must not consider themselves above the jokes. He said, I think people who laugh at a joke, they get a round of applause because people go, oh, that's good, they can take it. We don't want people to be above it. Ricky also added, we even let people be privileged as long as they say,  I know I'm privileged, but I'm nothing really.
We don't like people to go, oh, I deserve it, how dare you talk to me like that.","['first', 'actor', 'producer', 'writer', 'director', 'whose', 'movies', 'grossed', 'three', 'half', 'billion', 'dollars', 'box', 'office', 'hes', 'two', 'academy', 'awards', 'three', 'golden', 'globes', 'powerful', 'varied', 'performances', 'starring', 'films', 'philadelphia', 'forrest', 'gump', 'cast', 'away', 'apollo', '13', 'saving', 'private', 'ryan', 'tim', 'allen', 'ricky', 'even', 'leave', 'felicity', 'huffman', 'given', 'prison', 'sentence', 'cheating', 'scandal', 'college', 'exams', 'commented', 'made', 'license', 'plate', 'limo', 'comic', 'stop', 'made', 'many', 'jokes', 'people', 'sitting', 'audience', 'targeting', 'group', 'individually', 'many', 'pure', 'entertainment', 'offensive', 'viewers', 'noticed', 'tone', 'delight', 'rickys', 'jokes', 'elites', 'hollywood', 'ricky', 'gervais', 'appeared', 'staff', 'legends', 'podcast', 'revealed', 'revelations', 'show', 'host', 'show', 'comedian', 'reflected', 'clip', 'golden', 'globes', 'professional', 'making', 'jokes', 'using', 'humor', 'entertain', 'people', 'suggesting', 'tom', 'hanks', 'disapproved', 'content', 'jokes', 'might', 'wondering', 'first', 'time', 'ricky', 'hosted', 'show', 'audience', 'members', 'might', 'liked', 'jokes', 'well', 'host', 'hosted', 'ceremony', 'several', 'times', 'specifically', 'known', 'holds', 'barred', 'opening', 'monologues', 'comedy', 'focuses', 'celebrities', 'sitting', 'event', 'comedian', 'explained', 'anecdote', 'told', 'podcast', 'host', 'people', 'like', 'jokes', 'first', 'including', 'tom', 'hanks', 'said', 'arrogance', 'make', 'jokes', 'said', 'big', 'meme', 'tom', 'hanks', 'going', 'saying', 'people', 'going', 'oh', 'look', 'hes', 'high', 'horse', 'people', 'tend', 'follow', 'leaders', 'humans', 'famous', 'skilled', 'better', 'position', 'likewise', 'hollywood', 'one', 'personality', 'leonardo', 'dicaprio', 'surprise', 'audience', 'first', 'mocking', 'comedian', 'humor', 'started', 'applauding', 'soon', 'dicaprio', 'started', 'laugh', 'hosts', 'jokes', 'leonardo', 'dicaprio', 'attended', 'premiere', 'end', 'date', 'old', 'artist', 'signified', 'need', 'audience', 'comedian', 'take', 'jokes', 'get', 'offended', 'humor', 'standup', 'shows', 'often', 'crowd', 'works', 'similarly', 'award', 'shows', 'celebrities', 'joked', 'individually', 'ricky', 'gervais', 'people', 'must', 'consider', 'jokes', 'said', 'think', 'people', 'laugh', 'joke', 'get', 'round', 'applause', 'people', 'go', 'oh', 'thats', 'good', 'take', 'dont', 'want', 'people', 'ricky', 'also', 'added', 'even', 'let', 'people', 'privileged', 'long', 'say', 'know', 'im', 'privileged', 'im', 'nothing', 'really', 'dont', 'like', 'people', 'go', 'oh', 'deserve', 'dare', 'talk', 'like']",1,fake,0.5869319351500131

PLEASE FOLLOW ME 🙏",2024-01-10 06:07:20,Will Smith CONFRONTS Jim Carrey For HUMILIATING Him On Live TV," It's a gauntlet of devotion that you have to do. It was just a selfish moment that cast a pall over the whole thing. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences indicated they would be looking into the incident after the ceremony concluded. 

The Academy condemns the actions of Mr. Smith at last night's show, the organization said in a statement to Variety on Monday. We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct, and California law. 

The actor should have been arrested for punching Chris Walk at the Oscars, but Jim Carrey is being called out for hypocrisy for saying so. Tweets have shown a video of Carrie from June 1997 while he was accepting an award at the MTV Movie Awards. 

After accepting his prize for the cable guy, Carrie appears on stage and gives a forceful kiss to Alicia Silverstone on the lips, much to Silverstone's discomfort. At the time, Silverstone was only 20, while Carrie was over 35. 

The actor has been called a hypocrite for his remarks about the event involving Smith, and his behavior in the videos has also been criticized. The video has been shared thousands of times on Twitter since it was uploaded, albeit it should be noted that the majority of these tweets incorrectly state Silverstone's age. 

Apparently, he went backstage to apologize to a humiliated Silverstone. One Twitter user wrote, Jim Carrey says Will Smith should have been arrested for hitting Chris Rock. How about when Jim Carrey forcibly kissed Alicia Silverstone when he was going up on stage to accept an award? 

Imagine being Jim Carrey sickened by a slap while also being the same Jim Carrey who forcefully kissed Alicia Silverstone, tweeted another user. It had literally no impact on his career whatsoever, one of the actor's critics stated, with another adding, look at her reaction after he did it. 

She looks so disgusted. Even more actors than Carrie have been caught kissing award presenters without their will. After winning Best Actor for the pianist in 2003, Adrienne Brody stunned Hal Berry by kissing her. 

She told Andy Cohen in 2017 that her first reaction was that of extreme shock and disgust. Smith's slapping of rock quickly became the most talked about event from this year's Oscars ceremony, leading to significant criticism of his behavior from many Hollywood peers. 

Despite the incident, Smith received a standing ovation after he accepted the award for best actor for his portrayal of King Richard and afterward broke down in tears while accepting the award. After Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's bald head, referring to her as G.I.

Smith went on to accept the best actor Oscar for his role in King Richard after getting into a confrontation with the 53-year-old rapper and the 57-year-old satanite live star. All of the people at the Dolby theater on March 27th, when the Philadelphia native won,  came up to cheer him, as Kerry mentioned. In 2002 and 2007, Smith was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for best actor but ultimately did not win.

on to say that it's okay to yell from the audience if you don't approve of a joke.  But you do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words.
King argued that the incident escalated to that level, but Carey disagreed. It didn't escalate.  He said it came out of nowhere because Will has something going on inside him that's frustrated. I wish him the best. I really do. I don't have anything against Will Smith. He's done great things, but that was not a good moment. It cast a pall over everybody's shining moment. Other actors agreed. Watch the show. I'm sure you saw the moment everyone is talking about between Chris and Will.  Your thoughts.
I don't condone violence. I just don't see any reason for it."" The actor from Independence Day openly apologized for his actions at the Oscars the day after the night, stating that Chris Rock's joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's solo pita had been too much to bear.

Pinkett Smith has been very candid about her battles with Alopecia Carrey elaborated on his previous statements in a follow up interview with the Associated Press. I see it as a larger issue and it's an issue of the boundaries being broken, boundaries and allowances and permissiveness to certain behaviors, Carrey told the outlet. The fact is that license is being given to people to act up violently when they don't like what they hear and it just shouldn't be. The 60 year old showed compassion for Smith, saying he understood that Smith  felt pressured into his conduct. He said, I also think that people not unlike Will or myself, we live in a lot of pressure. We set up a lot of pressure for ourselves. We were encouraged by this country to never stop and never be satisfied and never look at our lives and going you know what? I'm enough. I have enough. I've done enough. I don't need nine businesses. I don't need to be a movie producer, director, writer, actor, star and have a record company and be on TikTok and be on social media and have a reality show and share my innermost life on some therapy show. Carrey continued, Its beyond our bandwidth and we're starting to see the symptoms of what it's like to be living beyond your bandwidth and cracking under the pressure. That's what it was. It was more than just an insult to someone's wife. Jade is a tough girl. She can defend herself. She wasn't being physically attacked.
What that was with someone who was beyond the bandwidth and he thought more about how he was looking in that moment than what was the right thing to do. The actor concluded, I dont condemn for it. It's just wrong. Jim Carrey has been rather candid about his history of mental illness. Thus the fact that he was able to identify indicators of some internal difficulties in Will Smith could be quite revealing. Mila Kunis, who was in attendance at the 2022 Academy Awards where Will Smith Slapp Chris Rock later told C Magazine in October 2022 that she was shocked by the number of people who rose to their feet during Smith's acceptance speech.
Not standing up to me was a no brainer but what was shocking to me was how many people did stand up, she said. I thought wow what a time we were living in that. Rather than do what's right, people focus on doing what looks good. It's insane to Pinkett. Smith, who has been married to Smith for nearly 25 years, finally broke her silence on the altercation in June 2022 on an episode of her Facebook watch series Red Table Talk. My deepest hope is that these two intelligent, capable men have an opportunity to heal, talk this out and reconcile. The Screen 2 star said at the time, the state of the world today, we need them both and we all actually need one another more than ever. She also noted that she has Smith's back in the aftermath of the scandal, adding, until then Will and I are continuing to do what we have done for the last 28 years and lets keep figuring out this thing called life together. Smith has already publicly apologized for the slap, so he and Rock have apparently patch things up and are back to being good buddies.

Your thoughts?” , “I don't condone violence. I just don't see any reason for it.” , “The actor from Independence Day openly apologized for his actions at the Oscars the day after the night, stating that Chris Rock's joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's alopecia had been too much to bear. I was out of line and I was wrong, he wrote via Instagram on March 28. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness. Carrey remains silent on the actor's apologies, but reaffirmed the difficulty of being nominated for an Oscar. He claimed that the entire occasion had been tarnished by Will's outburst. A lot of people worked really hard to get to that place and to have their moment in the sun to get their award for the really hard work they did, the ace venturist star told King. It is no main feat to go through all the stuff you have to go through when you're nominated for an Oscar. It's a gauntlet of devotion that you have to do. It was just a selfish moment that cast Apollo  over the whole thing. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences indicated they would be looking into the incident after the ceremony concluded.
The Academy condemns the actions of Mr. Smith at last night's show, the organization said in a statement to Variety on Monday. We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences. In accordance with our bylaws, standards of conduct and California law. The actor should have been arrested for punching Chris Rock at the Oscars, but Jim Carrey is being called out for hypocrisy for saying so. Tweets have shown a video of Carrie from June 1997 while he was accepting an award at the MTV Movie Awards.
After accepting his prize for the Cable Guy, Carrey appears on stage and gives a forceful kiss to Alicia Silverstone on the lips, much to Silverstone's discomfort. At the time, Silverstone was only 20 while Carrie was over 35. The actor has been called a hypocrite for his remarks about the event involving Smith and his behavior in the videos has also been criticized. The video has been shared thousands of times on Twitter since it was uploaded, albeit it should be noted that the majority of these tweets incorrectly state Silverstone's age. Apparently he went backstage to apologize to a humiliated Silverstone. One Twitter user wrote Jim Carrey, says, Will Smith should have been arrested for hitting Chris Rock. How about when Jim Carrey forcibly kissed Alicia Silverstone when he was going up on stage to accept an award. Imagine being Jim Carrey sickened by a slap, while also being the same Jim Carrey who forcefully kissed Alicia Silverstone, tweeted another user. It had literally no impact on his career whatsoever.
What of the actors? Critics stated, with another adding, look at her reaction after he did it.
She looked so disgusted. Even more actors than Carrie have been caught kissing. Award presenter.”

🇵🇸 resources ⬇️",2023-12-19 18:57:15,IDF soldiers demolishing the Palestinian Legislative Council Building in Gaza,"We'd love to see it. South Africa,  unlike Germany, is actually making some good decisions.  And it's saying that its citizens serving in the IOF could face prosecution back home.  It's concerned that its  people are committing war crimes  and therefore its naturalized citizens could be stripped of their nationality. President Ramaphosa once again denounces conflict as a genocide. Thank you, sir. The violation of international law and commission of further international crimes will make them liable for prosecution in South Africa.
South Africans need prior government approval to fight legally in Israel, but naturalized citizens are at further risk of being stripped of their South African nationality for engaging in a war that the country does not support or agree with. This is a Times of Israel article and I pulled it because I want to see how annoying they're being,  but this quote says, Israel is making efforts to avoid harm to civilians while fighting Hamas in difficult conditions,  since the terror group is waging war from within the civilian population, often using it as a cover.
but South Africa has always been a supporter of Palestine  and they have recalled their diplomats from  Is Not Real. Thank you, Mr. Ramaphosa.

And I think that that's a result of the fact that this government doesn't view the Palestinian people as the future partners for making peace with, and they are just convinced that overwhelming military power is going to bring us safety and security. And this is a catastrophic mistake. It's the same catastrophic mistake that led us to the horrific events of October 7th. And we absolutely need to change that.
We need our partners abroad. We need the US Government also. I'm an Israeli, but I'm also an American. And I expect that the American government also not just pay lip service to the idea of pursuing a political solution. You know, settlements are expanding at an incredible rate.
Settlers are illegally taking over land not even according to international law, according to Israeli law. They're going out and they're shooting at Palestinian civilians. And there's no with impunity.
There's no real enforcement against them. And so I think our international partners and allies need to take a stance on the side of the Israelis who are demanding a political solution and are demanding differentiation, and that our government makes sure not to harm and kill innocent civilians.”","['video', 'shows', 'former', 'idf', 'soldier', 'benzi', 'sanders', 'saying', 'dont', 'believe', 'israel', 'everything', 'power', 'prevent', 'civilian', 'casualties', 'based', 'statements', 'members', 'likud', 'members', 'coalition', 'think', 'thats', 'result', 'fact', 'government', 'doesnt', 'view', 'palestinian', 'people', 'future', 'partners', 'making', 'peace', 'convinced', 'overwhelming', 'military', 'power', 'going', 'bring', 'us', 'safety', 'security', 'catastrophic', 'mistake', 'catastrophic', 'mistake', 'led', 'us', 'horrific', 'events', 'october', '7th', 'absolutely', 'need', 'change', 'need', 'partners', 'abroad', 'need', 'us', 'government', 'also', 'im', 'israeli', 'im', 'also', 'american', 'expect', 'american', 'government', 'also', 'pay', 'lip', 'service', 'idea', 'pursuing', 'political', 'solution', 'know', 'settlements', 'expanding', 'incredible', 'rate', 'settlers', 'illegally', 'taking', 'land', 'even', 'according', 'international', 'law', 'according', 'israeli', 'law', 'theyre', 'going', 'theyre', 'shooting', 'palestinian', 'civilians', 'theres', 'impunity', 'theres', 'real', 'enforcement', 'think', 'international', 'partners', 'allies', 'need', 'take', 'stance', 'side', 'israelis', 'demanding', 'political', 'solution', 'demanding', 'differentiation', 'government', 'makes', 'sure', 'harm', 'kill', 'innocent', 'civilians']",0,real,0.3613468205614669

Idris mentioned that Tyler Perry's production was changing the way men, especially black men, were being portrayed in the media. 

Because of that role, it changed not only my career, but it also changed the way I believe that people cast black men. In support of Idris's observation, a close associate of Perry claimed that Perry's production had a tendency to emasculate black men due to the fact that he himself might be gay. 

Kyler made it clear that he said, look, no one can know that I'm gay. And I'm thinking, what? Are you looking around? Did you see all these sissies you hanging around at this table? Nobody could know that you're gay. 

He also alleged that from the very beginning of Tyler's career, he was working with black gay men. And that's why men working with Tyler end up taking on roles that force them to act out of their comfort zone. 

Perry helped him with his plays. I would say 90, 85 to 90% of the guys that supported Tyler Perry when he first started were all black gang. So what did Idra Elba expose about the nasty price black actors pay for working with Tyler Perry? 

Let's get into it. So when Tyler Perry was getting his star at the Hall of Fame, Idris Elba, who has worked with Tyler before, gave a speech where he complimented the Medea actor on how his production changed the way black men were being viewed in the industry, and his comments were met with conflicting opinions by the public. 

There is no question that Tyler Perry is a prominent player in the entertainment industry who worked his way to the top after taking the Atlanta theater community by storm and becoming a box office champ with his Medea series and gospel-based films. 

He gave audiences something Hollywood had largely ignored, stories and characters aimed at the life experiences of the black community. While some observers inside and outside the African American creative circle praised him for giving an opportunity to stories and experiences of the black, some claimed the sight of black male performers in drag also carried troubling cultural baggage.","['tyler', 'perrys', 'inauguration', 'hall', 'fame', 'idris', 'elba', 'exposed', 'productions', 'affected', 'black', 'actors', 'claiming', 'bone', 'pick', 'tyler', 'idris', 'mentioned', 'tyler', 'perrys', 'production', 'changing', 'way', 'men', 'especially', 'black', 'men', 'portrayed', 'media', 'role', 'changed', 'career', 'also', 'changed', 'way', 'believe', 'people', 'cast', 'black', 'men', 'support', 'idriss', 'observation', 'close', 'associate', 'perry', 'claimed', 'perrys', 'production', 'tendency', 'emasculate', 'black', 'men', 'due', 'fact', 'might', 'gay', 'kyler', 'made', 'clear', 'said', 'look', 'one', 'know', 'im', 'gay', 'im', 'thinking', 'looking', 'around', 'see', 'sissies', 'hanging', 'around', 'table', 'nobody', 'could', 'know', 'youre', 'gay', 'also', 'alleged', 'beginning', 'tylers', 'career', 'working', 'black', 'gay', 'men', 'thats', 'men', 'working', 'tyler', 'end', 'taking', 'roles', 'force', 'act', 'comfort', 'zone', 'perry', 'helped', 'plays', 'would', 'say', '90', '85', '90', 'guys', 'supported', 'tyler', 'perry', 'first', 'started', 'black', 'gang', 'idra', 'elba', 'expose', 'nasty', 'price', 'black', 'actors', 'pay', 'working', 'tyler', 'perry', 'lets', 'get', 'tyler', 'perry', 'getting', 'star', 'hall', 'fame', 'idris', 'elba', 'worked', 'tyler', 'gave', 'speech', 'complimented', 'medea', 'actor', 'production', 'changed', 'way', 'black', 'men', 'viewed', 'industry', 'comments', 'met', 'conflicting', 'opinions', 'public', 'question', 'tyler', 'perry', 'prominent', 'player', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'worked', 'way', 'top', 'taking', 'atlanta', 'theater', 'community', 'storm', 'becoming', 'box', 'office', 'champ', 'medea', 'series', 'gospelbased', 'films', 'gave', 'audiences', 'something', 'hollywood', 'largely', 'ignored', 'stories', 'characters', 'aimed', 'life', 'experiences', 'black', 'community', 'observers', 'inside', 'outside', 'african', 'american', 'creative', 'circle', 'praised', 'giving', 'opportunity', 'stories', 'experiences', 'black', 'claimed', 'sight', 'black', 'male', 'performers', 'drag', 'also', 'carried', 'troubling', 'cultural', 'baggage']",1,fake,0.7339247829456914

Todd Boyd, a professor of critical studies at the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts, said the roles humiliate and emasculate black men. It renders them less than powerful. Back in 2022, Tyler Perry defended some of his most popular films against accusations
that they feed into harmful stereotypes. Perry, who appeared on Chris Wallace's CNN and HBO Max series, Who's Talking to Chris Wallace, stood by his hit film franchise, which includes 12 movies in total.  During his conversation with Perry on the particular CNN episode, Wallace told his guest,  over the years, there have been a number of people who say that you're playing with negative stereotypes of black men and black women.
The host specifically mentioned Spike Lee's 2009 comments blasting the Madea films as buffoonery and insisting that we can do better than films like Perry's.  Emasculating black men, I've heard it all. Perry told Wallace, adding,  there's a certain part of our society, especially black people  in the culture that they look down on certain things within the culture.  For me, I love the movies that I've done because they are the people that I grew up with, that I represent.  He continued.  So when someone says
You're harkening back to a point in our life that we don't want to talk about or we don't want the world to see.  You're dismissing the stories of millions and millions of black people.  And that's why I think it's been so successful because it resonates with many of us who know these women and these experiences and Uncle Joe and so on and so forth. The filmmaker insisted he isn't disrespecting anyone in his films.  In fact, he's hoping to do the opposite, Perry said.  What is important to me  is that I'm honoring the people that came up and taught and made me who I am.  The first Madea film,
Diary of a Mad Black Woman was released in 2005 and  has spawned over a dozen spin-off films.  The most recent, A Madea Homecoming, premiered on Netflix earlier this year.  His Madea films have received the most love and also the most controversies with comedians mocking the character claiming that Madea was no old woman, but rather a man playing a woman.
With the fact that most roles given to black men by Tyler are usually stereotyped females or cross-dressers,  one of his close associates spoke up  and alleged that Tyler Perry is actually gay, and that's why he ends up putting other black men into those roles.  He even claimed that at the beginning of his career,  Tyler used to perform at gay events but had to cut back on associating with that part of himself.
based on the fact that he had built his entire brand on the black church.

And the kids did it, allegedly, because Next threw water at them. Forced to use a bathroom based off a gender they do not identify with, three students targeted Next and beat them and they wound up dead. This is a hate crime.
Multiple alumni from the school districts have reported the school having a very anti-LGBTQ agenda. They just do not care about their gay, trans, non-binary kids at all. The student lost her life because the school district didn't take bullying seriously. What's really fucked up about Oklahoma  is hate crime statute does not include  gender,  gender identity, sexual orientation. So anyone who is part of the LGBTQ plus community is not protected and it's costing children their lives for just being them.
May this school district have the day that they deserve for ignoring bullying.

And it's very short. And I read this is the word of the Lord. D Day shall be once again terror and unpreparedness revisited. This time on you, America. Ships will emerge out of the fog and you will be surrounded on both sides, east and west. They will squeeze you in a vice until you vomit out your treasures into the hands of your worst enemies. You will bow down before them in servitude and become slaves. If you think this is a joke, wait and see. D Day revisited. Wait and see. So that's the entire prophecy. And I made a note here, since this prophecy refers to a seab born invasion. Invasion by sea. A huge force of soldiers, allies working together for a common goal, and a decisive military blow struck against a common enemy. But most of all, this prophecy refers to a surprise. So I have prophecies on the blog where I've seen airborne invasion and so many soldiers parachuting down from the sky. I mean, the sky was just thick with them with foreign soldiers parachuting down from the sky. And I've also seen these huge hulls, you know, as if I'm standing on the beach and this massive ship comes out of the fog. And these ships are landing on the shores of America on the east coast and on the west coast. And she is utterly unprepared, does not even know that the beaches are being stormed. I've seen submarines coming up, you know, and soldiers storming the beaches, literally coming out of the sea as well. And the understanding that the Lord has given me actually clear. The clear thing that he has said is that this will be China and this will be Russia with their allies coming to invade the United States.","['prophecy', 'entitled', 'day', 'short', 'read', 'word', 'lord', 'day', 'shall', 'terror', 'unpreparedness', 'revisited', 'time', 'america', 'ships', 'emerge', 'fog', 'surrounded', 'sides', 'east', 'west', 'squeeze', 'vice', 'vomit', 'treasures', 'hands', 'worst', 'enemies', 'bow', 'servitude', 'become', 'slaves', 'think', 'joke', 'wait', 'see', 'day', 'revisited', 'wait', 'see', 'thats', 'entire', 'prophecy', 'made', 'note', 'since', 'prophecy', 'refers', 'seab', 'born', 'invasion', 'invasion', 'sea', 'huge', 'force', 'soldiers', 'allies', 'working', 'together', 'common', 'goal', 'decisive', 'military', 'blow', 'struck', 'common', 'enemy', 'prophecy', 'refers', 'surprise', 'prophecies', 'blog', 'ive', 'seen', 'airborne', 'invasion', 'many', 'soldiers', 'parachuting', 'sky', 'mean', 'sky', 'thick', 'foreign', 'soldiers', 'parachuting', 'sky', 'ive', 'also', 'seen', 'huge', 'hulls', 'know', 'im', 'standing', 'beach', 'massive', 'ship', 'comes', 'fog', 'ships', 'landing', 'shores', 'america', 'east', 'coast', 'west', 'coast', 'utterly', 'unprepared', 'even', 'know', 'beaches', 'stormed', 'ive', 'seen', 'submarines', 'coming', 'know', 'soldiers', 'storming', 'beaches', 'literally', 'coming', 'sea', 'well', 'understanding', 'lord', 'given', 'actually', 'clear', 'clear', 'thing', 'said', 'china', 'russia', 'allies', 'coming', 'invade', 'united', 'states']",1,real,0.3969427267924792

On September 1, 2023, a video shared online revealed the truth about NASA and the Megalodon shark exhibition in a shocking twist that has sent ripples through the world of marine biology and conspiracy theorists. It all began when a deep sea probe sent on a top secret mission by NASA to explore the uncharted depths of the Mariana Trench captured jaw dropping footage of an enormous creature lurking in the abyss. The footage, which was inadvertently leaked by Jason, a former NASA deep sea explorer and professional marine biologist who was part of the secret mission, showed what appeared to be a living Megalodon, a species long believed to be extinct. Jason leaked the jaw dropping footage of the Megalodon on the Internet.
The video went viral among a select group of people who managed to see it before NASA swiftly swung into action, deleting it within minutes of its appearance online. Jason went missing just a few days after the leap. His sudden disappearance has only fueled the conspiracy theories further. Some believe he uncovered something more sinister than the Megalodon, something that NASA was determined to keep hidden. People close to Jason have recently spoken out to reporters, revealing that just before his disappearance, he mentioned terrifying details about the Megalodon and the Mariana Trench expedition. His last words will send shivers down your spine.

In fact, garlic is useful for a lot of things: it keeps mosquitoes away, snakes away, and vampires away. Another thing they do is keep the water channels around the park moving constantly. This way, mosquitoes don't have stagnant water to thrive. Furthermore, they raise chickens that eat mosquitoes and are tested for diseases transmitted by these animals. Go buy some chicken.

And one way that they do this is they design all of their buildings and structures to not pool any water so that the mosquitoes can't breed. 

They also got rid of all of the swampy water and replaced it with constantly moving water. So obviously there's rides where there's moving water, but they also have fountains everywhere so that water at Disneyland is never still. 

And finally the results are in from this epic study where they genetically modified mosquitoes. So that the offspring of these genetically modified mosquitoes, all the females would die and the male mosquitoes would carry the genetically modified gene to the next generation to again kill all the female offspring, then have genetically modified male babies, etc. 

They did this study in Florida and they found that also the spread of these genetically modified mosquitoes only went about 400 meters. So it's not like it took over and like we had no more mosquitoes anymore, which I know we all know is gonna end the world.

No, not one. The engineer. That
discovered that keeping the water running or flowing prevented mosquitoes from reproducing. When began to make plans for Walt Disney World, Walt Disney personally assigned Potter, no, not one, to control and keep mosquitoes out of the parks. What Potter did was
No, it creating ditches, channels, levels around all water so that the water keeps flowing. Most them are hidden and are not visible at first sight. But in Disney there is always a fountain, a waterfall or something that does allow the water to sink. Architecture also plays an important All the ceilings and buildings are designed so that do form puddles, or least not for long time, so that mosquitoes could reproduce. Despite the design of the fountains and lakes, are still mosquitoes, because are still swamps around.
But to control how little it could see, Disney uses a extract. Yes, like Dracula,  mosquitoes can't the garlic Disney uses an imperceptible for humans, very sensitive to mosquitoes. In this way, don't use any chemicals that could damage the health of visitors.

Fountains like this make the water constantly flow, and with that, mosquitoes can't breathe. But that's not the only thing they did. They also installed drainage channels to stop rainwater from cooling up. And they even sprayed a special liquid around the park to chase mosquitoes away.

On Feb. 10, 2010 President Bill Clinton, then the UN Special Envoy to Haiti, publicly apologized for forcing Haiti to drop tariffs on imported, subsidized US rice during his time in office.  The policy wiped out Haitian rice farming and seriously damaged Haiti’s ability to be self-sufficient. [ Transcript ] “Since 1981, the United States has followed a policy, until the last year or so when we started rethinking it, that we rich countries that produce a lot of food should sell it to poor countries and relieve them of the burden of producing their own food, so, thank goodness, they can leap directly into the industrial era. It has not worked. It may have been good for some of my farmers in Arkansas, but it has not worked. It was a mistake. It was a mistake that I was a party to. I am not pointing the finger at anybody.

Heres what happened. Before the 1980s, Haiti was self sufficient in food consumption. We didn't depend on other nations in order to feed ourselves. For example, 90% of the rice consumed in Haiti was grown locally in the Atkabunet area. For a long time, the IMF and the US Government were trying to change that by pressuring Haiti to lower tariffs on agricultural products. Haiti had high tariffs or taxes on imported food, which protected locally grown agriculture. Although experts warned that lowering the tariffs would be disastrous for Haiti, it was also clear that these lower tariffs would be a benefit to the United States. U.S. farmers were able to get rid of their surplus crops. They took everything they weren't able to sell in America and they dumped it in Haiti under the guise of food aid.
This was possible because in 1991, there was a quiditta overthrowing the Haitian president Alistid. Although the US played a role in the quiditta, they agreed to help restore Alistid to power if he would agree to a couple of things, like lowering the rice tariff. In exchange for political and financial support. The Clinton administration was able to force Haiti to make a decision that ultimately would destroy our rice industry. In 1995, after being pressured by the Clinton administration and the IMF, Haiti decided to lower the tariff on rice from 50% to 3%, the lowest in the Caribbean. A surge of rice poured into Haiti every year. The US Government began paying US Farmers hundreds of millions of dollars from US aid in order to give their excess rice to Haiti.
Most of the imported rice came from Arkansas, Clinton's home state. And so Clinton's farmers benefited greatly while Haitian farmers completely lost their livelihoods. That's why in his apology, Clinton said it may have been good for some of his farmers in Arkansas.
Despite his apology, the impact is still there. Haiti still has the lowest tariff on rice in the Caribbean. And Haiti is now the 5th largest importer of American rice in the world.
Instead of us producing 90% of the rice we consume, we're importing 90% of the rice we consume. This is why initiatives like the Canal are so important. We're rebuilding what has been destroyed. And so we say Canala Pop Compet.”","['video', 'shows', 'woman', 'saying', '2010', 'bill', 'clinton', 'publicly', 'apologized', 'destroying', 'haiti', 'rice', 'industry', 'heres', 'happened', '1980s', 'haiti', 'self', 'sufficient', 'food', 'consumption', 'didnt', 'depend', 'nations', 'order', 'feed', 'example', '90', 'rice', 'consumed', 'haiti', 'grown', 'locally', 'atkabunet', 'area', 'long', 'time', 'imf', 'us', 'government', 'trying', 'change', 'pressuring', 'haiti', 'lower', 'tariffs', 'agricultural', 'products', 'haiti', 'high', 'tariffs', 'taxes', 'imported', 'food', 'protected', 'locally', 'grown', 'agriculture', 'although', 'experts', 'warned', 'lowering', 'tariffs', 'would', 'disastrous', 'haiti', 'also', 'clear', 'lower', 'tariffs', 'would', 'benefit', 'united', 'states', 'us', 'farmers', 'able', 'get', 'rid', 'surplus', 'crops', 'took', 'everything', 'werent', 'able', 'sell', 'america', 'dumped', 'haiti', 'guise', 'food', 'aid', 'possible', '1991', 'quiditta', 'overthrowing', 'haitian', 'president', 'alistid', 'although', 'us', 'played', 'role', 'quiditta', 'agreed', 'help', 'restore', 'alistid', 'power', 'would', 'agree', 'couple', 'things', 'like', 'lowering', 'rice', 'tariff', 'exchange', 'political', 'financial', 'support', 'clinton', 'administration', 'able', 'force', 'haiti', 'make', 'decision', 'ultimately', 'would', 'destroy', 'rice', 'industry', '1995', 'pressured', 'clinton', 'administration', 'imf', 'haiti', 'decided', 'lower', 'tariff', 'rice', '50', '3', 'lowest', 'caribbean', 'surge', 'rice', 'poured', 'haiti', 'every', 'year', 'us', 'government', 'began', 'paying', 'us', 'farmers', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'dollars', 'us', 'aid', 'order', 'give', 'excess', 'rice', 'haiti', 'imported', 'rice', 'came', 'arkansas', 'clintons', 'home', 'state', 'clintons', 'farmers', 'benefited', 'greatly', 'haitian', 'farmers', 'completely', 'lost', 'livelihoods', 'thats', 'apology', 'clinton', 'said', 'may', 'good', 'farmers', 'arkansas', 'despite', 'apology', 'impact', 'still', 'haiti', 'still', 'lowest', 'tariff', 'rice', 'caribbean', 'haiti', '5th', 'largest', 'importer', 'american', 'rice', 'world', 'instead', 'us', 'producing', '90', 'rice', 'consume', 'importing', '90', 'rice', 'consume', 'initiatives', 'like', 'canal', 'important', 'rebuilding', 'destroyed', 'say', 'canala', 'pop', 'compet']",0,real,0.4583693737685676

And he had already been deported multiple times before his latest arrest.  Alicia Cunha is live in Denver to fill in the missing pieces on this story. Alicia, good morning. Hi, good morning, Bill. Four times,  four times ICE officials tell Fox News they deported the suspect, Jose Menivar. And if convicted in this deadly crash, it will be his sixth  DUI.
In a bond hearing yesterday, the judge agreed to a $250,000 cash bond.  Witnesses say Menovar was driving about 100 miles an hour  when he slammed into the car Melissa Powell and her 16-year-old son Reardon were driving.  Menovar is charged with killing them both.  Toxicology results show his blood alcohol level was three times the legal limit.  ICE tells Fox Menovar is from El Salvador and was first removed from this country in 2009.
When in the U.S. he has been in and out of jail.  Bill listen to this.  days  before the deadly accident he pled guilty to a previous DUI offense. According to court documents  Boulder County Judge Zachary Malkinson sentenced him to probation and work release.  Even his prosecutors requested a year in jail.  In a statement to Fox News the DA's office says the prosecutor correctly believed the defendant was a danger to the community.
Instead, the judge ordered 365 days of work release.  The court allowed the defendant to wait out of custody for a bed in the work release program  over our office's objection.  ICE tells Fox News their records show, the subject has been previously removed and has no regard for immigration law  as part of its routine operations.  ICE targets and arrests non-citizens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation's immigration laws.  And Bill, look at this.
This is the Colorado Bureau of Investigations list of men of ours, appearances and his arrests. In addition to DUIs, reckless driving, there's child abuse and domestic violence and of course, failure to appear in court. Wow. He is next scheduled to appear in court on March 12th.

Here's why #elonmusk #spacejunk #moon #spacex,real,1.0,"USA TODAY, TikTok tomorrow",2022-01-28 19:05:33,rocket hitting the moon,"A SpaceX rocket took off from Cape Canaveral seven years ago and now the upper stage of it is evidently go goingna hit the moon. Projections say on March 4th. So when this Falcon 9 rocket took off in February of 2015, this part of the rocket, the upper stage was not meant to come back to Earth. It was meant to get a laboratory into space. The laboratory is called the Deep Space Climate Observatory and it basically, you know, takes pictures of the Earth and watches for interesting weather. So you know, the satellites weren't supposed to be, but the rocket is kind of just had been flying around because it didn't, it wasn't meant to come back to Earth. Some amateur and professional astronomers started realizing wait a minute, this thing is finally going to hit the moon. As far as as experts know, this is the first time a man made object has accidentally hit the moon. Now this piece of the upper stage of the Falcon 9 rocket weighs about 4 tons. It's going to be going about 5,000 miles an hour. You know it's going to hit the moon, but it's not really going to hurt anything because things are going that fast all the time. And hitting the moon, I mean the reason that craters is because asteroids and you know, natural objects have hit the moon over thousands and hundreds of thousands of years. What's interesting is this is going to happen on the far side of the moon. So we can't really see it, so we won't really know what happens. There is a growing concern about space jump.

Rockets, which are used to propel satellites and spacecraft into orbit, are designed to fall back toward Earth. But that didn't happen in this case.

“No. Plastic is a foreign body. It's a foreign particle. In fact, it'll break down into nano plastics. And nanoparticles in general, have the issue of being able to penetrate cell membranes. So it can penetrate very deeply into the cell. It can cause inflammation. Your body doesn't know how to deal with it. It's a foreign object, so you'll get the inflammatory response when you encounter these. But to make things worse, the microplastics themselves are a foreign body, but they also release plasticizer chemicals when they're in contact with your body. And they can also carry toxic chemicals into your body. Actually, microplastics that have been detected in human lung,
blood, and placenta. And who knows how much of this is getting into babies? Are babies being born with plastic in their bodies? I would guess to make yes.

After the ocean liner sank during its 1912 Maide in Voyage, researchers spent decades looking for the wreckage. Finally, in 1985, the downship was found more than 12,000ft below the surface by the Woods Hole oceanic institution expedition. Lee Dr. Robert Ballard described his first time seeing the ship as spooky. After hitting the iceberg, the Titanic broke in half. The stern roughly tumbled through the water before slamming into the ocean floor so hard that every deck was flattened. However, the bow struck the ocean floor at such an angle that large sections of the interior remained intact. Ballard, who first took photos of the ship when his team discovered it in 1985, returned nine months later to capture it on video. Using a human occupied submersible named Alvin in a remotely operated vehicle named Jason Jr. The team was able to film the wreckage for the first time. The footage is being publicly released now to coincide with and celebrate the 25th anniversary of James Cameron's epic 1997 film Titanic.","['first', 'known', 'footage', 'titanic', 'bottom', 'ocean', 'floor', 'taken', '1986', 'first', 'time', 'much', 'footage', 'released', 'public', 'ocean', 'liner', 'sank', '1912', 'maide', 'voyage', 'researchers', 'spent', 'decades', 'looking', 'wreckage', 'finally', '1985', 'downship', 'found', '12000ft', 'surface', 'woods', 'hole', 'oceanic', 'institution', 'expedition', 'lee', 'dr', 'robert', 'ballard', 'described', 'first', 'time', 'seeing', 'ship', 'spooky', 'hitting', 'iceberg', 'titanic', 'broke', 'half', 'stern', 'roughly', 'tumbled', 'water', 'slamming', 'ocean', 'floor', 'hard', 'every', 'deck', 'flattened', 'however', 'bow', 'struck', 'ocean', 'floor', 'angle', 'large', 'sections', 'interior', 'remained', 'intact', 'ballard', 'first', 'took', 'photos', 'ship', 'team', 'discovered', '1985', 'returned', 'nine', 'months', 'later', 'capture', 'video', 'using', 'human', 'occupied', 'submersible', 'named', 'alvin', 'remotely', 'operated', 'vehicle', 'named', 'jason', 'jr', 'team', 'able', 'film', 'wreckage', 'first', 'time', 'footage', 'publicly', 'released', 'coincide', 'celebrate', '25th', 'anniversary', 'james', 'camerons', 'epic', '1997', 'film', 'titanic']",0,real,0.4498198751386841

There is some we need to be aware of our anavid Reyes has a look at Yes, Veronica, we are out here 57 on I 24 East. you're don't expect too many delays out here. Things look to be over my left shoulder. You some minor road construction in
much this morning and oh by the way just real quick my name is pronounced Anavide not Anavide so if I'm gonna come out here and do these live traffic reports and literally risk my life I'd appreciate if somebody back in the studio could learn how to pronounce my name. Oh I'm sorry you got it Anavide. Yeah. And what's it look like southbound? I mean just like in the grand scheme of life think about what we're doing right now I'm doing a live traffic report on television this traffic report is going to be obsolete in
three minutes. mean, I know I have a report that there's trash, there's construction in the area, obviously, as you know, but there's a wreck about a mile ahead. And so this is going to be all this traffic is going to be changed in literally about 60 seconds. So it looks like you've got an inside source on that wreck. Have you been in contact with the police chief? Have I talked to the police chief? No, I have not. I've actually just literally looked on Google maps and every time you guys send me out here,
for live traffic report. I literally just look on Google Maps. Oh look, traffic. I look on Google Maps and report to you what I see here. And I don't know if you guys knew this back at the station, but every person in America has access to this. Well, it looks cold.
And it sounds like you may have woken up on the wrong side of the bed. Yeah, I don't know. Or woken up on the wrong side of the bed. most people are still in bed because no one's watching the local news for traffic. Like, in terms of figuring out the best route to work and traffic patterns, I can think of, off the top of my head, 57 other ways to do this more efficiently. Google Maps, Apple Maps, Bing Maps. My Uncle Ricky still has a TomTom. You can plug the address into that. I don't know.
go to a truck stop and rent a CV and talk to one of these truck drivers he could probably tell you a better way to know what the traffic is I mean I'm just trying to figure out why thank you and a V","['weekend', 'need', 'aware', 'anavid', 'reyes', 'look', 'yes', 'veronica', '57', '24', 'east', 'youre', 'dont', 'expect', 'many', 'delays', 'things', 'look', 'left', 'shoulder', 'minor', 'road', 'construction', 'much', 'morning', 'oh', 'way', 'real', 'quick', 'name', 'pronounced', 'anavide', 'anavide', 'im', 'gon', 'na', 'come', 'live', 'traffic', 'reports', 'literally', 'risk', 'life', 'id', 'appreciate', 'somebody', 'back', 'studio', 'could', 'learn', 'pronounce', 'name', 'oh', 'im', 'sorry', 'got', 'anavide', 'yeah', 'whats', 'look', 'like', 'southbound', 'mean', 'like', 'grand', 'scheme', 'life', 'think', 'right', 'im', 'live', 'traffic', 'report', 'television', 'traffic', 'report', 'going', 'obsolete', 'three', 'minutes', 'mean', 'know', 'report', 'theres', 'trash', 'theres', 'construction', 'area', 'obviously', 'know', 'theres', 'wreck', 'mile', 'ahead', 'going', 'traffic', 'going', 'changed', 'literally', '60', 'seconds', 'looks', 'like', 'youve', 'got', 'inside', 'source', 'wreck', 'contact', 'police', 'chief', 'talked', 'police', 'chief', 'ive', 'actually', 'literally', 'looked', 'google', 'maps', 'every', 'time', 'guys', 'send', 'live', 'traffic', 'report', 'literally', 'look', 'google', 'maps', 'oh', 'look', 'traffic', 'look', 'google', 'maps', 'report', 'see', 'dont', 'know', 'guys', 'knew', 'back', 'station', 'every', 'person', 'america', 'access', 'well', 'looks', 'cold', 'sounds', 'like', 'may', 'woken', 'wrong', 'side', 'bed', 'yeah', 'dont', 'know', 'woken', 'wrong', 'side', 'bed', 'people', 'still', 'bed', 'ones', 'watching', 'local', 'news', 'traffic', 'like', 'terms', 'figuring', 'best', 'route', 'work', 'traffic', 'patterns', 'think', 'top', 'head', '57', 'ways', 'efficiently', 'google', 'maps', 'apple', 'maps', 'bing', 'maps', 'uncle', 'ricky', 'still', 'tomtom', 'plug', 'address', 'dont', 'know', 'go', 'truck', 'stop', 'rent', 'cv', 'talk', 'one', 'truck', 'drivers', 'could', 'probably', 'tell', 'better', 'way', 'know', 'traffic', 'mean', 'im', 'trying', 'figure', 'thank', 'v']",1,fake,0.9246429814821103

That is why every European country that borders Russia and that does not want Russia to tear them apart should be a full member of the EU and NATO.

The January 6th committee showed parts of the video minutes before voting to subpoena the former president, who responded today in a rambling, 14-page letter never saying whether he'd comply, instead reiterating false claims of election fraud, 

calling the panel's members hacks and thugs, and referencing in words and photos the size of the crowd he drew on January 6th. Committee member Zoe Lofgren. Would there be any value if he agreed to do this live in front of the country, in front of the cameras? 

Possibly. I mean, first we need an indication that he's willing to talk to us, and then we'll work out the details. But so far, it's all cap answers with the same old, same old false statements. The committee said it's also considering criminal referrals for key players. 

An important move, says former Justice Department official Michael Greenberger. Would a criminal referral put pressure on the Justice Department or are they immune to that? It would put pressure on them. 

They aren't obliged to follow what Congress is referring to them, but it definitely puts pressure on them. Questions have been raised about why the committee waited so late in its work to move on this subpoena.

Road safety applies to all road users and sadly a heartbraking turn of events occured when a 14 year old girl and the bus driver sadly lost their lives! #roadsafety #roadusers #busdriver #schoolbus #police,real,0.0,Road safety tips delivered differently.,2023-09-30 18:48:03,a school bus driver having vaccine-caused heart attack,"Diminished it after 8 am when emergency services were contacted. Merseyside Police later said they received a report that a bus had struck a reservation on the motorway and that no other vehicle had been involved. At the time there were 54 people on board, mostly school children, some of whom reportedly clambered out of the back window below which pools of broken glass now litter the road. The accident happened near Hooton in Cheshire on a north band section of the M53 close to Junction 5. The bus was travelling in a convoy of other buses, taking children to two schools on the Wirral, West Kirby and Caldy Grange grammars. Following reports of a crash involving a coach this morning, we declared a major incident. This was due to the potential number of casualties involved. As a result, we sent a substantial number of ambulances, senior clinicians and our hazardous area response teams. A critical care doctor was also dispatched to the scene. Tragically, we can confirm that there were two fatalities as a result of this crash. One was the driver of the bus, the other who died, a 14 -year -old girl. Of those injured, two were said to be in a serious condition. Two children were taken from the scene to Alderhey Children's Hospital. Fifty of the children were taken to an emergency training centre where they were medically assessed and eight of those children have been taken to the Countess of Chester and Arupark hospitals. Specialist support said the police was being provided to the families involved to the children who were on the bus and to others who saw it all unfold. We also know that other children from both schools were on buses travelling in convoy with the bus involved in the incident. And they witnessed the incident and they too will be provided with specialist trauma support. We're all counsel said it was working closely with the schools affected. Schools described by the council's leader today as very close -knit communities for whom he added, today's events will be devastating.","['diminished', '8', 'emergency', 'services', 'contacted', 'merseyside', 'police', 'later', 'said', 'received', 'report', 'bus', 'struck', 'reservation', 'motorway', 'vehicle', 'involved', 'time', '54', 'people', 'board', 'mostly', 'school', 'children', 'reportedly', 'clambered', 'back', 'window', 'pools', 'broken', 'glass', 'litter', 'road', 'accident', 'happened', 'near', 'hooton', 'cheshire', 'north', 'band', 'section', 'm53', 'close', 'junction', '5', 'bus', 'travelling', 'convoy', 'buses', 'taking', 'children', 'two', 'schools', 'wirral', 'west', 'kirby', 'caldy', 'grange', 'grammars', 'following', 'reports', 'crash', 'involving', 'coach', 'morning', 'declared', 'major', 'incident', 'due', 'potential', 'number', 'casualties', 'involved', 'result', 'sent', 'substantial', 'number', 'ambulances', 'senior', 'clinicians', 'hazardous', 'area', 'response', 'teams', 'critical', 'care', 'doctor', 'also', 'dispatched', 'scene', 'tragically', 'confirm', 'two', 'fatalities', 'result', 'crash', 'one', 'driver', 'bus', 'died', '14', 'year', 'old', 'girl', 'injured', 'two', 'said', 'serious', 'condition', 'two', 'children', 'taken', 'scene', 'alderhey', 'childrens', 'hospital', 'fifty', 'children', 'taken', 'emergency', 'training', 'centre', 'medically', 'assessed', 'eight', 'children', 'taken', 'countess', 'chester', 'arupark', 'hospitals', 'specialist', 'support', 'said', 'police', 'provided', 'families', 'involved', 'children', 'bus', 'others', 'saw', 'unfold', 'also', 'know', 'children', 'schools', 'buses', 'travelling', 'convoy', 'bus', 'involved', 'incident', 'witnessed', 'incident', 'provided', 'specialist', 'trauma', 'support', 'counsel', 'said', 'working', 'closely', 'schools', 'affected', 'schools', 'described', 'councils', 'leader', 'today', 'close', 'knit', 'communities', 'added', 'todays', 'events', 'devastating']",0,real,0.42825195331115107

She kind of went, ha!  And cowered in fear.
Starbucks Barbie would be in the view.  Aldean files defamation suit against Whoopi Goldberg  and the View. I am no racist is what Jason Aldean had to say to that situation. you didn't see my- have to realize that when you  make it about Black Lives Matter, people kind of say, well, are you, are you  talking about Black people? What are you talking about here? Whoopi Goldberg is in the news again, and this time it appears it's from the veteran actor Tom Selleck, who apparently isn't holding back.
He's dishing the dirt on Whoopi's eyebrow-raising controversies. From jaw-dropping statements to headline-making feuds, Whoopi has been in the public spotlight many, many times. But perhaps none of her controversies so far have been as dramatic as Jason Aldean's latest lawsuit against her. Show, you know, so I think everybody was just kind of stunned and really didn't know what to do or what was going on or anything. Yeah. Who is Jason Aldean, you ask?  Jason Aldean's latest track, Try That in a Small Town.
has stirred up quite a commotion since its music video dropped. Despite the song's initial May release,  it climbed to the none-too-spot on the Billboard Hot 100 only after the music video hit the scene a few weeks ago.  In the video, we see protests and confrontations with the police,  sparking controversy.  Nevertheless,  despite all the attention and criticism, the song has defied expectations and secured its place on the charts, racking up an impressive 22 million views for the music video.
Aldean's lyrics don't mince words.  Cuss out a cop, spit in his face, stomp on the flag and light it up. Yeah, you think you're tough. We'll try that in a small town. See how far you make it down the road.  Around here, we take care of our own. You cross that line, it won't take long for you to find out. I recommend you don't. This person pointed out the recent big fight in Alabama that went down and how Jason Aldean  kept catching heat from it. The way Jason Aldean is catching all the fucking strays with this Alabama situation is tickling me.
Another person tweeted about the situation saying,  this is what happens when you and your racist hillbilly buddies try that in a small town. Enjoy that A-swap in.  And this person had a very hilarious take on the whole situation. Racist was the wrong word to describe that Jason Aldean track.  A better description for me is a, it's trash, don't bother.

The Peoples Fund of Maui, it turns out, is owned and operated by the Entertainment Industry Foundation, a nonpr profit organization with close ties to, you guessed it, the entertainment industry. Thats right folks. The charity we all thought was going to help the needy citizens of Maui is actually in bed with the Hollywood elite. Once this bombshell was dropped, the rumor mill went into overdrive and questions about transparency and ethics started flooding in. But heres where it gets really scandalous. The fat cat executives over at EIF seem to be living the high life, while the rest of us are left wondering where the alleged $10 million went.  In fact, some people are convinced that the donations made to the Peoples Fund of Maui might not even get to the intended recipients. You see, reports came crashing down revealing that the president of EIF is raking in a hefty salary north of $400,000 a year. The CEO isnt far behind pocketing over $300,000 annually And lets not forget the CFO casually stashing away more than $290,000 each year. Not to mention the 29 other individuals on EIFS payroll who are laughing all the way to the bank. With salaries exceeding $100,000 each year, these 13 top tier executives are collectively rolling in a mind boggling $3.2 million while the lower level workers, the ones actually doing the charity heavy lifting, are left to scrape by on an average of approximately $64,527 per year.

Been holding onto this for too long, Hanks tweeted, attaching a series of documents and photos seemingly indicating questionable land dealings. Oprah's real estate game in Maui isn't about paradise. It's about profit at the cost of the locals. While the documents are yet to be verified,
The claims have already sent shockwaves across the entertainment industry. The alleged plan suggests the acquisition of vast expanses of land, possibly displacing local communities in favor of luxury resorts and private estates. Fans of both stars are in disarray, with some praising Hanks for speaking out while others caution patients, suggesting more clarity is needed before passing judgment. Representatives for Oprah Winfrey have been quick to label the allegations as baseless and defimatory, promising a more detailed statement soon.
Meanwhile, legal experts are dissecting the documents shared by Hanks, aiming to determine their authenticity. As Hollywood grapples with this latest controversy, all eyes are on Maui, awaiting further developments in this unfolding saga. A day after Tom Hanks' startling claims about Oprah Winfrey's alleged controversial land deals in Maui, Hawaii, Oprah has broken her silence. In a press conference held earlier today, the media mogul addressed the allegations head on, providing context and presenting her side of the story.
The Maui project is no exception. Oprah began  expressing her disappointment over the way the information was presented. She went on to detail her plans, which contrary to Hanks's claims reportedly involves sustainable tourism and collaboration with local communities.  am deeply committed to ensuring that the local culture, traditions and livelihoods are not only preserved, but uplifted. Oprah explained sharing blueprints and project details. She also mentioned an initiative to provide scholarships to Maui's youth aiming to ensure they benefit directly from any developments.
The response from the public has been mixed. While some fans are relieved and express their trust in Oprah's intentions, others argue that the controversy has highlighted broader concerns about large-scale land acquisitions in sensitive areas.

7284669885525888302,Part 3: Joe Rogan Reveals Why Matt Damon Pr*stituted Himself Into Fame #news #fyp #moses #foryou #hollywood #drama #scandal,fake,0.0,,2023-09-30 17:19:47,Joe Rogan on How Matt Damon 'Prostituted' Fame,"was crucial,  as it revealed a troubling aspect of the entertainment industry's culture of silence. For context, Paltrow had previously shared her disturbing encounter with Weinstein,  describing how he had invited her to a hotel under the guise of a work meeting, only to make unwelcome advances and suggest they go to the bedroom for massages.  Paltrow, then 22 years old, felt petrified during the encounter and later confided in her then-boyfriend Brad Pitt, who confronted Weinstein.
Damon's acknowledgement of his knowledge about Paltrow's ordeal raises important questions about complicity and silence. While he claimed that he never discussed it with Paltrow, he did reveal that Ben Affleck, another actor closely associated with Weinstein, had informed him about the situation.  Damon recounted that Affleck had told him there was an understanding between Weinstein and Paltrow, and that Weinstein had treated her incredibly respectfully afterward.
This revelation highlights the complex web of relationships and power dynamics that permeated Hollywood. Damon's silence, as Joe Rogan suggested, might have been driven by the fear of losing the support of a powerful figure who was instrumental in his rise to stardom. In fact, it is alleged that Damon went as far as to cover up Weinstein's essay. You see, in 2017, the rap founder Sharon Waxman accused the New York Times of backing down from a similar story in 2004.
due to intense pressure from high profile people such as Damon and Russell Crowe.  Waxman said her piece revolved around an executive at the Italian branch of Miramax  who had supposedly been paid just to facilitate Weinstein's essay.  She added, after intense pressure from Weinstein, which included having Matt Damon and Russell Crowe call me directly to vouch for Lombardo and unknown discussions well above my head at the Times, the story was gutted.
I was told at the time that Weinstein had visited the newsroom in person to make his displeasure known.  I knew he was a major advertiser in the Times and that he was a powerful person overall.  In response, Damon said he had no knowledge about the subject of Waxman's story. He said Weinstein only told him that the paper was doing a hit job on Lombardo.  Harvey said Sharon Waxman is writing a story about Fabrizio and it's really negative. Can you just call and tell her what your experience with Fabrizio was?  So I did and that's what I said to her.
It didn't even make the piece that she wrote.  As I recall, her piece just said that Russell and I had called and relayed our experience with Fabrizio, he said.  Meanwhile, fans have not shied away from expressing their thoughts concerning Matt Damon's alleged allegiance to Weinstein.  One particular person wrote,  I wouldn't say Matt Damon is a bad guy necessarily, but he looks out for himself.  He's been friends and connected to a lot of horrible people, but doesn't say anything or says he didn't know. He stays in his lane to the point of letting horrible stuff happen.
A second person talked about the risks that came with exposing the Hollywood elite. They said, let's be honest, if Matt Damon or Ben Affleck

Just gonna start with a couple of bones I have to pick with you. 1, in 2007 you cast me as Monty in Daddy's Little Girls.
Idris mentioned that Tyler Perry's production was changing the way men, especially black men, were being portrayed in the media.
Because of that role, it changed not only my career, but it also changed the way I believe that people cast black men.
In support of Idris' observation, a close associate of Perry claimed that Perry's production had a tendency to emasculate black men due to the fact that he himself might be gay.
Tyler made it clear that he said, look, no 1 can know that I'm gay. And I'm thinking, what? Are you looking around? Did you see all these sissies you hanging around at this table where nobody can know that you're gay?
Also alleged that from the very beginning of Tyler's career, he was working with black gay men. And that's why men working with Tyler end up taking on roles that forced them to act out of their comfort zone.
Perry helped him with his plays. I would say 90 85 to 90% of the guys that supported Tyler Perry when he first started were all black gay men.
What did Idra Elba expose about the nasty price black actors pay for working with Tyler Perry? Let's get into it. So when Tyler Perry was getting his star at Hall of Fame, Idris Elba, who has worked with Tyler before, gave a speech where he complimented the Madea actor on how his production changed the way black men were being viewed in the industry and his comments were met with conflicting opinions by the public. There is no question that Tyler Perry is a prominent player in the entertainment industry who worked his way to the top after taking the Atlanta theater community by storm and becoming a box office champ with his Madea series and gospel based films.","['tyler', 'perrys', 'inauguration', 'hall', 'fame', 'idris', 'elba', 'exposed', 'productions', 'affected', 'black', 'actors', 'claiming', 'bone', 'pick', 'tyler', 'gon', 'na', 'start', 'couple', 'bones', 'pick', '1', '2007', 'cast', 'monty', 'daddys', 'little', 'girls', 'idris', 'mentioned', 'tyler', 'perrys', 'production', 'changing', 'way', 'men', 'especially', 'black', 'men', 'portrayed', 'media', 'role', 'changed', 'career', 'also', 'changed', 'way', 'believe', 'people', 'cast', 'black', 'men', 'support', 'idris', 'observation', 'close', 'associate', 'perry', 'claimed', 'perrys', 'production', 'tendency', 'emasculate', 'black', 'men', 'due', 'fact', 'might', 'gay', 'tyler', 'made', 'clear', 'said', 'look', '1', 'know', 'im', 'gay', 'im', 'thinking', 'looking', 'around', 'see', 'sissies', 'hanging', 'around', 'table', 'nobody', 'know', 'youre', 'gay', 'also', 'alleged', 'beginning', 'tylers', 'career', 'working', 'black', 'gay', 'men', 'thats', 'men', 'working', 'tyler', 'end', 'taking', 'roles', 'forced', 'act', 'comfort', 'zone', 'perry', 'helped', 'plays', 'would', 'say', '90', '85', '90', 'guys', 'supported', 'tyler', 'perry', 'first', 'started', 'black', 'gay', 'men', 'idra', 'elba', 'expose', 'nasty', 'price', 'black', 'actors', 'pay', 'working', 'tyler', 'perry', 'lets', 'get', 'tyler', 'perry', 'getting', 'star', 'hall', 'fame', 'idris', 'elba', 'worked', 'tyler', 'gave', 'speech', 'complimented', 'madea', 'actor', 'production', 'changed', 'way', 'black', 'men', 'viewed', 'industry', 'comments', 'met', 'conflicting', 'opinions', 'public', 'question', 'tyler', 'perry', 'prominent', 'player', 'entertainment', 'industry', 'worked', 'way', 'top', 'taking', 'atlanta', 'theater', 'community', 'storm', 'becoming', 'box', 'office', 'champ', 'madea', 'series', 'gospel', 'based', 'films']",1,fake,0.7825925533475515

So it seems like Travis Kelsey and Taylor Swift have some pretty exciting times ahead of them. Watch this space for some more heartwarming updates on this star-studded love story. 

And we get that people want more updates, but it looks like Travis wants the world to calm down now. Travis Kelsey and Taylor Swift have been pretty open about their relationship. But when it comes to some details, the NFL star is playing it close to the best. 

During a press conference before the Kansas City Chiefs game in Germany, he was asked about their status. Travis, Everett the Charmer, responded with a grin. The latest status is I got to see her last week. 

That's the latest status right there. But when a particularly bold reporter prodded him about whether he's in love with the heiress to her singer, Travis firmly stated, I'm going to keep my personal relationship personal. 

And when the question of whether Taylor would be attending his next game came up, he didn't give away any spoilers. With a little mischievous smile, he quipped, when I mention or everybody knows that she's at the game, the Vegas, the you know what I mean? 

Like the over-under on my catches kind of goes up and down. The spread goes up and down. So, you know, I don't want to mess with any of that stuff. So I'm just going to keep it to myself. So it looks like Travis Kelsey is keeping some things close to his chest. 

And we can't blame him for wanting to protect their private moments. We all just have to wait for the love story to unfold in its own time. The fact that there have been discussions about Taylor Swift potentially getting married to Joe Altwin, her long-term partner, certainly suggests that she might be thinking about marriage in her future. 

If Taylor is open to the idea of marriage, it could mean that her relationship with Travis Kelsey has some promising potential in that direction as well. Of course, the specifics about their relationship and future plans remain private, but it's always exciting to speculate about the possibility of a celebrity wedding. 

Time will tell if wedding bells are in the future for Travis Kelsey and Taylor Swift. We just have to wait and see how this love story unfolds. Ultimately, only Travis Kelsey and Taylor Swift know the real deal here, and they're entitled to their privacy. 

So until we get an official statement from them, let's just keep the speculation light and fun. After all, it's just exciting to see two talented and successful individuals find happiness, whether it's in love or friendship. 

For now, let's just sip on that coffee, listen to some T-Swift tunes, and enjoy this intrigue. If there's an engagement announcement in the future, we will be there to celebrate with them. Until then, stay tuned, folks, and may the rumors ever be in your favor.

But could these two worlds really collide in a romantic engagement? Let's consider the evidence. Travis and Taylor were spotted recently together in New York City a few weeks ago, and they seem to be having a great time, sharing laughs and even dancing together. 

Sure, it could just be two celebrities enjoying each other's company, but we can't help but wonder if there might be a spark there. And then there's the social media chatter. Fans have been dissecting their Instagram posts and Twitter interactions like it's a national pastime. 

They've been leaving comments like, OMG, are they wearing matching watches? And they liked each other's posts again, you guys. It's all very Sherlock Holmes, isn't it? The main reason why things have come to this point is that we are seeing things progress in their relationship now. 

So in the middle of that epic showdown between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Denver Broncos, Travis Kelsey, the tight end extraordinaire, had a little distraction at Arrowhead Stadium on October 12th. 

Forget the touchdowns and tackles, because what was catching his eye was the scene in the stance, and he totally didn't see it coming. It was a meeting of the minds.

That wasn't the only word he mispronounced during this rally. But he finished this rally by making just very weird beep, bop, boop sounds. Ding, boom. This is me. I hear for months Donald Trump has been questioning Joe Biden's competency, attacking him almost days. But Trump himself has been making gaffe after gaffe on the campaign trail.

From 1979 to 1981, there are about 29 murders in the Atlanta area that appear to be linked. Most of the victims were boys and all of them were black. The majority were young and some were even children. The community then named the killing spree the Atlanta child murders. The first victims of the Atlanta child murders were two boys, one 14 and the other 13.
both of whom disappeared within three days of each other. Both were found dead on the side of the road beside each other on July 28th, 1978. One was shot while the other was strangled to death. From there, bodies continued to pile up. By March 1980, the death toll had reached at least six. Every lead in the Atlanta child murder case turned up to be nothing for local authorities. Before long, it was time for the FBI to step in.
famous FBI profiler John Douglas weighed in on a potential killer profile of the Atlanta murders culprit.  He had already devoted much of his work to interviewing serial killers and assassins.  So it's no surprise that Douglas had a hunch about this particular case.  In his case files on the Atlanta child murders,  Douglas reported that he believes the murderer was someone black and not white.  He theorized that in order to have access to black children, the Atlanta killer would need access to the black community without any suspicion.
By late May of 1981,  many of the dead bodies linked to the case had been recovered within the same geographic parameters.  Some had been pulled out of the Chattahoochee River,  so investigators staked out its bridges.  That's when they found Wayne Williams, who was awfully close to where Nathaniel Carter's body was later discovered.  The body of 21-year-old Jimmy Ray Payne was also found, apparently allowing cops to build their case.
It wasn't until June 21st, about a month after the discoveries of the bodies, that police were able to arrest Wayne Williams.  He was cuffed after it was found that his alibis were fake  and he failed a polygraph test. Police  also had collected fibers from Williams' car and his family dogs.  These same fibers were found on both Carter and Payne's bodies.
In February, 1982, Williams was convicted and subsequently handed two life sentences for the murders of Payne and Carter.  Williams was never convicted of the rest of the murders in the Atlanta child murders case,  but local police alleged that he was responsible for them.  However, some Atlanta residents, including relatives of the Atlanta child murders victims, believe he did not commit those crimes.  Wayne has consistently maintained his innocence ever since he was put in jail decades ago.
In one 1991 interview, Williams said he accepts his fate and that God has a plan for him.

Keep in mind that 29 years ago was 1994. A partheid was ended in the early 1900s, with 1994 being the year that it truly ended. Carlson says that the Democrats are turning the US into South Africa because South Africa punishes white people and the US and the Democrats are trying to do the same thing now. This is despite the fact that white South Africans earn nearly three times the average wage made by black South Africans, even though the black population makes up 80% of the South African population. A partheid was basically South Africa's version of segregation. And it's insane to me that Tucker Carlson is basically saying that ending a partheid was bad for South Africa. He constantly says that the white race in America is under attack because people of color are coming in here.

Here The Supreme Court has reversed a ruling from the Colorado Supreme Court that would have removed former President Trump from the ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, the so called insurrectionist ban. Now this is very much what we expected based on what we saw about a month ago. During oral argument, justices on both sides of the aisle appeared skeptical of Colorado's argument that Trump could be removed by the state under the 14th amendment. So this is a huge win. It means that former President Trump will appear on the primary ballot. And this applies not only to Colorado, but also to states across the country. Cause as we've seen, many states have tried this way of moving, removing Trump from the ballot. It was considered a novel, long shot way to bump Trump out of, you know, out of eligibility for the White House. But we've only seen Colorado, Maine and Illinois actually remove him. But here the Supreme Court, as you know, the final word on constitutional questions, saying no, it is up to Congress, not the states, to do this.

👇 News Roundup email",2024-03-04 16:39:30,80 Trump Ballots Burned,"The video shows a report saying “U.S.Supreme Court just unanimously sided with former President Donald Trump and said, yes, he can appear on ballots across the country regardless of the 14th Amendment. But what's also important is what the justices did not say. So first, I'm going to tell you what they did say. Unanimously, the Supreme Court ruled in a short 13-page ruling that the Colorado Supreme Court went too far when it ruled that former President Trump could not appear on Colorado's ballot because he's an insurrectionist and he violated Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court said no.
When it comes to the office of the president, the majority of the Supreme Court ruled today that determining whether someone violated the 14th Amendment is a job for Congress.
Essentially, the justices rule today that when states ratified the 14th Amendment back in 1868, which prohibits insurrectionists from holding office, they didn't really say how those insurrectionists should be prevented from holding office. Today, the justices said it should be up to Congress to decide how that process works. If Congress wants to pass a law that says, yeah, states do have the power to remove a candidate because he or she is an insurrectionist and violates the 14th Amendment, then they can do that. Or if Congress wants to pass a law that says only Congress can decide that, they can do that too. But until Congress says something about it, the states cannot make this decision on their own. The Supreme Court says, States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency. However, the Supreme Court said states can enforce the 14th Amendment if the person involved is running for a state office. Now to what the Supreme Court did not say today. They did not rule on whether or not former President Trump is an insurrectionist. This ruling actually says nothing about that. The justices also did not say anything about whether a candidate running for the office of president of the United States is subject to the 14th Amendment. Former President Trump was trying to argue that the president is not an officer of the United States. Therefore, the 14th Amendment does not apply to him.
The Supreme Court actually said nothing about that either. It's also important to understand that while the three liberal justices did sign on to this majority opinion, they wrote what's called a concurring opinion, which says the majority went too far when they said it's up to Congress to decide how to apply the 14th Amendment. The liberal justices say that's a step too far because there may be other ways the 14th Amendment could be imposed on those holding or attempting to hold federal office. So if you want to read this short 13-page ruling from the Supreme Court, I will email it out to you tonight in my News Girl News Roundup email. So make sure you sign yourself up.”","['video', 'shows', 'report', 'saying', 'ussupreme', 'court', 'unanimously', 'sided', 'former', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'said', 'yes', 'appear', 'ballots', 'across', 'country', 'regardless', '14th', 'amendment', 'whats', 'also', 'important', 'justices', 'say', 'first', 'im', 'going', 'tell', 'say', 'unanimously', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruled', 'short', '13page', 'ruling', 'colorado', 'supreme', 'court', 'went', 'far', 'ruled', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'could', 'appear', 'colorados', 'ballot', 'hes', 'insurrectionist', 'violated', 'section', '3', '14th', 'amendment', 'supreme', 'court', 'said', 'comes', 'office', 'president', 'majority', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruled', 'today', 'determining', 'whether', 'someone', 'violated', '14th', 'amendment', 'job', 'congress', 'essentially', 'justices', 'rule', 'today', 'states', 'ratified', '14th', 'amendment', 'back', '1868', 'prohibits', 'insurrectionists', 'holding', 'office', 'didnt', 'really', 'say', 'insurrectionists', 'prevented', 'holding', 'office', 'today', 'justices', 'said', 'congress', 'decide', 'process', 'works', 'congress', 'wants', 'pass', 'law', 'says', 'yeah', 'states', 'power', 'remove', 'candidate', 'insurrectionist', 'violates', '14th', 'amendment', 'congress', 'wants', 'pass', 'law', 'says', 'congress', 'decide', 'congress', 'says', 'something', 'states', 'make', 'decision', 'supreme', 'court', 'says', 'states', 'power', 'constitution', 'enforce', 'section', '3', 'respect', 'federal', 'offices', 'especially', 'presidency', 'however', 'supreme', 'court', 'said', 'states', 'enforce', '14th', 'amendment', 'person', 'involved', 'running', 'state', 'office', 'supreme', 'court', 'say', 'today', 'rule', 'whether', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'insurrectionist', 'ruling', 'actually', 'says', 'nothing', 'justices', 'also', 'say', 'anything', 'whether', 'candidate', 'running', 'office', 'president', 'united', 'states', 'subject', '14th', 'amendment', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'trying', 'argue', 'president', 'officer', 'united', 'states', 'therefore', '14th', 'amendment', 'apply', 'supreme', 'court', 'actually', 'said', 'nothing', 'either', 'also', 'important', 'understand', 'three', 'liberal', 'justices', 'sign', 'majority', 'opinion', 'wrote', 'whats', 'called', 'concurring', 'opinion', 'says', 'majority', 'went', 'far', 'said', 'congress', 'decide', 'apply', '14th', 'amendment', 'liberal', 'justices', 'say', 'thats', 'step', 'far', 'may', 'ways', '14th', 'amendment', 'could', 'imposed', 'holding', 'attempting', 'hold', 'federal', 'office', 'want', 'read', 'short', '13page', 'ruling', 'supreme', 'court', 'email', 'tonight', 'news', 'girl', 'news', 'roundup', 'email', 'make', 'sure', 'sign']",0,real,0.3079872351020262

👇 News Roundup email",2024-02-29 03:09:28,80 Trump Ballots Burned,"The video shows a woman saying “A judge in Illinois
out of nowhere just ruled that former President Trump will be blocked from appearing on the state ballot because he violated the 14th amendment. This makes Illinois the third state to block Trump from their ballot after both Colorado and Maine did the same thing tonight. In the 72 page ruling, a Cook County judge ordered the Illinois Board of elections must remove Trump from the ballot ahead of the state primary that's happening in just about three weeks and says any vote for Trump will be suppressed because he's not qualified to even be on the ballot. But the Republican delegates, just for the record, in the state will still be free to vote for Trump as a Republican Party nominee at the GOP convention this summer regardless of this ruling. This whole case comes after a group of voters in Illinois objected to Trump's canency because they say he engaged in insurrection in January. Illinois State Election Board ruled that they didn't have the authority to remove Trump, so the petitioners took their complaint to court. There was a hearing a few weeks ago and then this ruling randomly came down tonight. Now the judge did stay or pause her own ruling until this Friday to give Trump time to appeal, but even that may not stop him from being kicked off of Illinois primary ballot on March 19th. There are only two ways really at this point that Trump's name can stay on that ballot. 1. If Trump is successful in the next three weeks to appeal this ruling and have either the Illinois Appeals Court or Illinois Supreme Court issue an emergency stay or pause on this ruling, or two, if the US Supreme Court finally issues their ruling and decides that Colorado Supreme Court was wrong to remove Trump from that state ballot, and in theory that ruling would then also apply to Illinois, Trump's legal team says they will quickly appeal this decision.”","['video', 'shows', 'woman', 'saying', 'judge', 'illinois', 'nowhere', 'ruled', 'former', 'president', 'trump', 'blocked', 'appearing', 'state', 'ballot', 'violated', '14th', 'amendment', 'makes', 'illinois', 'third', 'state', 'block', 'trump', 'ballot', 'colorado', 'maine', 'thing', 'tonight', '72', 'page', 'ruling', 'cook', 'county', 'judge', 'ordered', 'illinois', 'board', 'elections', 'must', 'remove', 'trump', 'ballot', 'ahead', 'state', 'primary', 'thats', 'happening', 'three', 'weeks', 'says', 'vote', 'trump', 'suppressed', 'hes', 'qualified', 'even', 'ballot', 'republican', 'delegates', 'record', 'state', 'still', 'free', 'vote', 'trump', 'republican', 'party', 'nominee', 'gop', 'convention', 'summer', 'regardless', 'ruling', 'whole', 'case', 'comes', 'group', 'voters', 'illinois', 'objected', 'trumps', 'canency', 'say', 'engaged', 'insurrection', 'january', 'illinois', 'state', 'election', 'board', 'ruled', 'didnt', 'authority', 'remove', 'trump', 'petitioners', 'took', 'complaint', 'court', 'hearing', 'weeks', 'ago', 'ruling', 'randomly', 'came', 'tonight', 'judge', 'stay', 'pause', 'ruling', 'friday', 'give', 'trump', 'time', 'appeal', 'even', 'may', 'stop', 'kicked', 'illinois', 'primary', 'ballot', 'march', '19th', 'two', 'ways', 'really', 'point', 'trumps', 'name', 'stay', 'ballot', '1', 'trump', 'successful', 'next', 'three', 'weeks', 'appeal', 'ruling', 'either', 'illinois', 'appeals', 'court', 'illinois', 'supreme', 'court', 'issue', 'emergency', 'stay', 'pause', 'ruling', 'two', 'us', 'supreme', 'court', 'finally', 'issues', 'ruling', 'decides', 'colorado', 'supreme', 'court', 'wrong', 'remove', 'trump', 'state', 'ballot', 'theory', 'ruling', 'would', 'also', 'apply', 'illinois', 'trumps', 'legal', 'team', 'says', 'quickly', 'appeal', 'decision']",0,real,0.3567607480358602
7342536380523859231,BREAKING: The #SupremeCourt unanimously rules states cannot kick #DonaldTrump off any 2024 ballot.,real,1.0,Your trusted source for the top news around the 🌎,2024-03-04 15:52:28,80 Trump Ballots Burned,"Breaking news from the Supreme Court about former president Donald Trump. The high court just said moments ago that mister Trump can stay on this year's presidential ballot in Colorado after that state barred him from its Republican primary. Colorado Supreme Court had disqualified mister Trump under a a constitutional provision that bars people who engage in insurrection from holding office. The decision today, of course, coming ahead of tomorrow's Super Tuesday contest when 15 states, including Colorado, will hold primary elections. This was a case that was about Colorado, but it sounds like this is going to have ramifications that extend beyond just that state.
Absolutely. Craig, the Republican front runner is now permitted to run for president not only in Colorado but across all 50 states. The justices here in a unanimous decision rejecting Colorado's effort to ban him under the constitution's so called insurrection clause, the heart of this case, about the meaning of a largely untested provision of the constitution, section 3 of the fourteenth amendment, which says essentially that if you take an oath to uphold the constitution and then you engage in insurrection, you are not permitted to hold that office once again. But again, the court here is saying because the constitution makes congress rather than the states responsible for enforcing section 3 against federal office holders and candidates, we reverse.","['breaking', 'news', 'supreme', 'court', 'former', 'president', 'donald', 'trump', 'high', 'court', 'said', 'moments', 'ago', 'mister', 'trump', 'stay', 'years', 'presidential', 'ballot', 'colorado', 'state', 'barred', 'republican', 'primary', 'colorado', 'supreme', 'court', 'disqualified', 'mister', 'trump', 'constitutional', 'provision', 'bars', 'people', 'engage', 'insurrection', 'holding', 'office', 'decision', 'today', 'course', 'coming', 'ahead', 'tomorrows', 'super', 'tuesday', 'contest', '15', 'states', 'including', 'colorado', 'hold', 'primary', 'elections', 'case', 'colorado', 'sounds', 'like', 'going', 'ramifications', 'extend', 'beyond', 'state', 'absolutely', 'craig', 'republican', 'front', 'runner', 'permitted', 'run', 'president', 'colorado', 'across', '50', 'states', 'justices', 'unanimous', 'decision', 'rejecting', 'colorados', 'effort', 'ban', 'constitutions', 'called', 'insurrection', 'clause', 'heart', 'case', 'meaning', 'largely', 'untested', 'provision', 'constitution', 'section', '3', 'fourteenth', 'amendment', 'says', 'essentially', 'take', 'oath', 'uphold', 'constitution', 'engage', 'insurrection', 'permitted', 'hold', 'office', 'court', 'saying', 'constitution', 'makes', 'congress', 'rather', 'states', 'responsible', 'enforcing', 'section', '3', 'federal', 'office', 'holders', 'candidates', 'reverse']",0,real,0.2494155515925359

They can bury up to 3,000 nuts in a single season, and their method depends on the species. So American red squirrels bury al their nuts at the base of a single tree, which makes it easier to defend from other squirrels. That's called the central bank or larder hoarding. My favorite is the mixed strategy where squirrels will organize their caches by the nut type. So they'll have the almonds in one area, the acorns in another area, and the peanuts in another area. I just think that's so cute. My final and favorite method is the scatter hoarding method, which is like the information economy, where squirrels that forage over a wider area will plant the nuts closer to where they're found, both to avoid bringing them back to a central location and to avoid other squirrels finding their stashes. They also regularly dig fake holes to throw the other squirrels off and re dig up their own buried nuts throughout the winter and replant them in other spots so they don't forget where they planted them. They're like rehearsing. Inevitably, some nuts are never found, and they grow into a new generation of especially oak, walnut, and hickory trees to feed the next generation of local squirrels.

This rocky visitor to our night sky remains a fairly unfamiliar place with many unresolved mysteries.  The latest one has left scientists baffled.
A group of researchers from Arizona say that a mystery rocket crashed on the moon in the month of March.  No one knows where it came from or what it looked like,  whether it was meant for the moon or spiraled out of trajectory.
But a rocket crashed for sure.  It struck the fair side of the moon at 7.25 a.m. Eastern time on March 4th.  The crash site was the Hepsprang Crater, a 350-mile wide basin  that's out of sight of anyone on Earth.  And here's the most intriguing bit.  The impact of the crash created not one, but two craters.  This is unusual by scientific standards.
No other rocket crash on the moon has created double craters,  not once in history.  Scientists say this may be because the rocket had large masses at each end,  but this too  is unusual. Typically, a rocket has mass concentrated at the mortar end. The rest of the body consists of an empty fuel tank.  So the mystery persists.  No one on Earth is owning up and the speculation is falling flat.  At first,
Scientists say the rocket was the second stage  of a SpaceX Falcon 9 launched in 2015.  But its trajectory was found incompatible and the theory was junked.  After more digging, scientists say it was a Long March  3C rocket launched from China way back in October 2014.  Beijing has denied this.  It said  that rocket had re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and burned up.
So  all we have  are false positives.  What will it take to solve this mystery?  Time.  The researchers who made this discovery say they need more time to feel the gums.  To find out if the rocket was launched by humans  or  by an extraterrestrial species.

Let's talk about those. A A cup, by nature, should absorb water. If it's not absorbing water, then that means there must be a barrier in between the paper and the liquid. And that barrier is polyethylene plastic. A study found that in 15 minutes of contact with hot liquids, leached 25,000 microplastic particles into your cup. But no one's questioning this. No one's really thinking about it because it's just part of our daily lives. Are we very good at metabolizing plastics? No. Plastic is a foreign body. It's a foreign particle. In fact, it'll break down into nanoplastics. And nanoparticles in general have the issue of being able to penetrate cell membranes. So it can penetrate very deeply into the cell. It can cause inflammation. Your body doesn't know how to deal with it. It's a foreign object. So you'll get the inflammatory response when you encounter these. But to make things worse, the microplastics themselves are a foreign body, but they also release plasticizer chemicals when they're in contact with your body. And they can also carry toxic chemicals into your body. The fact that they can basically invade and integrate into ourselves and you are what you eat, are we turning into real life Barbie and Candles? We could be because there's actually microplastics that have been detected in human, lung, blood and placenta. And who knows how much of this is getting into babies? Are babies being born with plastic in their bodies?

Initially, Malaysian investigators didn't dismiss the notion of deliberate diversion of the aircraft's course, while debris including some confirmed and suspected pieces from the plane
surface along Africa's coast and Indian Ocean Island. In 2018, Malaysia enlisted Ocean Infinity to explore the southern Indian Ocean with a pledge of up to $70 million for locating the aircraft. Prior to this, Malaysia, China, and Australia terminated a fruitless two-year $200 million Australian underwater search in January 2017. Anthony Loeck mentioned that the US seabed exploration company Ocean Infinity
has been approached to discuss the latest search plan following two unsuccessful efforts. He added that Malaysia intends to engage with Australia regarding collaboration for resuming the search once Ocean Infinity's proposal receives approval from Malaysia's cabinet. On March 8, 2014, flight MH370 of Boeing 777 with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board disappeared while flying from Kuala Lumpur
to Beijing.  This year marks its 10th anniversary of aircraft's disappearance.

Well, not literally. They just recently announced their invisibility cloak. But these aren't new. And I'm gonna show you exactly how it works, led by this physicist named Chu, who claim they're gonna use it on people as well as weapons. With aircraft undergoing testing using this technology, which even they claim they currently have no way of detecting something that's cloaked, as it also blocks heat, so even thermal cameras can't spot anything using it. The screen uses special light bending material so that any light passing through it gets refracted by the background, and anything positioned close enough to the screen becomes invisible. But this technology has actually been around for quite a while. Also known as quantum stealth, these shields are made up of a bunch of tiny clear cylinders called lenticular lenses. And when light passes through a cylinder, it converges into a single point like this, smearing any object between the screen and that single point so much that it basically turns invisible. Anything beyond that point of refraction becomes horizontally reversed, which is why everything is so blurry when looking through it. But then again, this is just the technology available to the public.

Imagine the possibilities. The world of science fiction has long toyed with the concept of invisibility, but today, we're stepping into reality. In a recent reveal that seems straight out of a Harry Potter novel, China has unveiled an invisible cloak.  Yes, you heard it right.  An invisible cloak. This isn't a magic trick or a clever camera angle.  It's a real tangible product of cutting edge technology.  Now you might be asking yourself,
how does an invisible cloak work?  Well, it's all about bending light.  The cloak uses a complex array of lenses and reflectors to bend light around an object,  effectively rendering it invisible to the naked eye.  Think of it like water flowing around a rock in a stream. The water doesn't stop, it simply goes around the rock. Similarly, the light doesn't stop, it just bends around the object.  This innovation is a game changer, not just for the world of espionage or defense,  but for numerous other fields as well.  Think about it.
Wildlife photographers could get closer to their subjects without disturbing them.  Researchers could observe natural behavior more accurately, and the list goes on.  But every coin has two sides.  While the advantages are numerous, the ethical implications of such technology are also worth considering.  Invisibility could potentially be misused in the wrong hands, leading to a whole new set of challenges.  It's a classic case of technology outpacing our ability to fully comprehend its implications.  To sum it up,
The invisible cloak is here,  and it's as mind-boggling as it sounds.  It's a testament to human innovation and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.  Yet it's also a reminder of the responsibility we carry to use such advancements wisely. After all, with great power comes great responsibility. So, in the world where invisibility is no longer just a science fiction dream, let's remember to keep our eyes wide open to the possibilities and implications it brings along.
After all what we can't see can indeed change the world.

They've been together for seven years now. Recently, they celebrated their second wedding anniversary. Amy shared a bunch of photos on social media. It's amazing to think that seven years have gone by since she went on her first bike ride with him. After Matt's ex-wife divorced him, she started spending time with other single people. She went on a date with a man named Bob to a painting event in Portland. There, she met Chris and they started talking. Later on, Chris went to a pool party but seemed a bit shy. This was shown on the TV show Little People, Big World during the 16th season. He then took her for a bike ride, and three years after that, they went on a long road trip together on his bike. Amy Roloff and Chris just seemed to get along really well. Fans of the show were excited and hoped they would get engaged and married. However, the wedding didn't happen as quickly as some impatient TLC fans hoped. The star of Little People, Big World took two years after getting engaged to finally have the wedding. This delay was because she had to move into a new home and save enough money for both the new house and the wedding. Eventually, they got married at Roloff Farms two years ago. On August 28th, the TLC personality posted numerous pictures on her Instagram of her and Chris. Some were taken during their trips, while others displayed them having fun on the beaches of the Pacific Northwest. Along with the photos, the main figure of little people, Big World wrote, Happy second anniversary, Chris, my love. I adore our amazing, sometimes wild and busy, yet simple life that we're living together. Amy Roloff then shared about their meeting many years ago. She went on to say, met seven years ago and now look where we are. Chris, I love you not only today but also all of my tomorrows. Here's to us. Predictably, many people quickly sent their congratulations to the couple, as Chris as well liked. Naturally, they are delighted to see his wife so joyful. Amy Roloff's post received over 20,000 likes in just a few hours, and there were already close to a thousand comments. Besides sending their congratulations, some fans shared kind words with them. One fan commented, Happy anniversary to you both! Another follower wrote, Happy anniversary to you and Chris! Hope that you enjoy this sweet day to the fullest together!

Emmy Roloff, a beloved reality TV star from Little People, Big World, found herself at the center of a devastating accident, changing the course of her life forever. At approximately 7 p.m., the air was shattered by the screeching sound of tires and the jarring impact of not just one, but two vehicles. Amy, caught in the middle of the chaos, was left in a critical condition, her life hanging in the balance. Emergency services arrived swiftly, their urgency a reflection of the gravity of the situation. Reports of her injuries were grim, necessitating immediate and extensive medical intervention. As the news of Amy's critical state spread like wildfire, a wave of support, prayers, and well-wishes flooded social media. Fans, friends, and the entertainment industry rallied around her, hoping and praying for her recovery. At the hospital, her closest circle of friends and family gathered, their anxious faces a testament to the profound impact Amy had made on their lives. In a race against time, a team of dedicated surgeons fought tirelessly to save Amy. Their delicate yet determined efforts aimed to repair the extensive damage she had sustained. The air was thick with tension and hope as everyone clung to the possibility of a positive outcome. But despite the best efforts of the medical team, tragedy struck, leaving behind a void that seemed impossible to fill. The news of Amy's untimely passing shook the community to its core. Amidst the shock and mourning, questions arose about the circumstances leading to the accident. Authorities launched a thorough investigation, determined to shed light on the events that had led to the collision, yet the public was left with only fragments of information, the full picture shrouded in uncertainty. Emy Roloff's life was a testament to resilience, courage, and unwavering determination. As friends and family gathered to bid their final farewells, the air was heavy with both sorrow and celebration.

Long before he became a household name, Steve Harvey grappled with a significant obstacle that could have stifled his aspirations, a debilitating stutter. 

In a heartwarming revelation on the Club Shea Shea show in 2023, Harvey opened up about this childhood, where closed miss marked him and teachers questioned the feasibility of his dreams. However, a silver lining emerged in the form of his father's unwavering belief in him and the unexpected support from a deli owner. 

As Harvey recounted, the deli owner not only provided him with a sweet incentive for conquering his daughter, but also imparted invaluable advice. The technique of repeating thoughts, taking one's time, and speaking on the sale became a lifeline for Harvey, shaping not only his ability to communicate, but also influencing his motivational talks. 

Today, he continues to share this wisdom with aspiring individuals, emphasizing the connection between stuttering, nerves, and the power of self-reflection. Growing up in a financially strained environment, Harvey's childhood was marked by the stark contrast between his modest dwelling and the extravagant homes adorned with Christmas lights in the suburbs. 

In a pointing reflection during a commercial break on Family Feud in 2022, he shared the driving force behind his relentless pursuit of success. I was sick and tired of being poor. I was just exhausted, he admitted. 

The desire to own a grand house with a horseshoe driveway fueled his determination, becoming a catalyst for his unyielding work ethic. True to his promise to the young boy he once was, Harvey now resides in home that boasts drivesways with gates on both sides, and his Christmas celebrations rival the ones that captivated his childhood imagination. 

It's a testament to his journey from poverty to opulence, a journey marked by tenacity, hard work, and an unshakable belief in the power of dreams. Harvey's path to success was not without its share of personal trials, particularly in the realm of love and marriage. 

His first marriage to Marcia Harvey in 1981, a union that produced three children, crumbled under the weight of his virgin and comedic career.

And I want you to get a good look at this man because this is the man who's single-handedly responsible for this one. And it makes you wonder
What can be so bad about TikTok to where they're always pushing for this to try to ban it in our country? Now, clearly they think it's dangerous because they can't push their own narratives  on TikTok. You know, we're not watching mainstream media no more. We don't care about Fox or CNN because on TikTok we can get the live uncensored and unfiltered information and news coverage on this app between the people.
not them, the people. And you've probably seen this pop up a lot on your for you page lately, but I want you guys to go ahead and check out this video right here because apparently  this is not going to happen. Yeah. So this content creator right up here actually spoke to a congressman  and they actually confirmed that that part never actually passed. Now I'm solely making this video because it's not to scare everybody. Like ticktocks actually getting banned. That's not going to happen, which is the good news, but the bad news is
they won't stop and they keep pushing for this.

(0:00:20) Well, I've had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci. Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear. I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackage formed of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents. The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology are over. I thank all of our passionate supporters who stood by us through it all. That we had people volunteer to come to Iowa in the middle of a blizzard to knock on doors and make phone calls touched us dearly. No candidate had more thrown at him, but no candidate had so many committed volunteers and staff. Finally, I want to thank my wife, Casey, and our kids, Madison, Mason, and Mamie. Casey's gone far above and beyond in her support for our campaign and for our cause. She's not only a great wife and mother, she's a great American who cares deeply about the future of the country that our kids will inherit. Our kids have seen and done a lot on the trail, from playing on the famed Field of Dreams baseball site in Iowa to making their first snowman in New Hampshire. They are one of the reasons we fight so hard for what we believe in. Winston Churchill once remarked that success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts. While this campaign has ended, the mission continues. Down here in Florida, we will continue to show the country how to lead. Thank you and God bless.","['today', 'suspending', 'campaign', 'im', 'proud', 'delivered', '100', 'promises', 'stop', 'clear', 'majority', 'republican', 'primary', 'voters', 'want', 'give', 'donald', 'trump', 'another', 'chance', 'watch', 'presidency', 'get', 'stymied', 'relentless', 'resistance', 'see', 'democrats', 'using', 'lawfare', 'day', 'attack', '00020', 'well', 'ive', 'disagreements', 'donald', 'trump', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'elevation', 'anthony', 'fauci', 'trump', 'superior', 'current', 'incumbent', 'joe', 'biden', 'clear', 'signed', 'pledge', 'support', 'republican', 'nominee', 'honor', 'pledge', 'endorsement', 'cant', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'republican', 'guard', 'yesteryear', 'repackage', 'formed', 'warmedover', 'corporatism', 'nikki', 'haley', 'represents', 'days', 'putting', 'americans', 'last', 'kowtowing', 'large', 'corporations', 'caving', 'woke', 'ideology', 'thank', 'passionate', 'supporters', 'stood', 'us', 'people', 'volunteer', 'come', 'iowa', 'middle', 'blizzard', 'knock', 'doors', 'make', 'phone', 'calls', 'touched', 'us', 'dearly', 'candidate', 'thrown', 'candidate', 'many', 'committed', 'volunteers', 'staff', 'finally', 'want', 'thank', 'wife', 'casey', 'kids', 'madison', 'mason', 'mamie', 'caseys', 'gone', 'far', 'beyond', 'support', 'campaign', 'cause', 'shes', 'great', 'wife', 'mother', 'shes', 'great', 'american', 'cares', 'deeply', 'future', 'country', 'kids', 'inherit', 'kids', 'seen', 'done', 'lot', 'trail', 'playing', 'famed', 'field', 'dreams', 'baseball', 'site', 'iowa', 'making', 'first', 'snowman', 'new', 'hampshire', 'one', 'reasons', 'fight', 'hard', 'believe', 'winston', 'churchill', 'remarked', 'success', 'final', 'failure', 'fatal', 'courage', 'continue', 'counts', 'campaign', 'ended', 'mission', 'continues', 'florida', 'continue', 'show', 'country', 'lead', 'thank', 'god', 'bless']",0,real,0.19363603876351781

Follow for eye-opening,2024-01-22 00:53:23,DeSantis Saying Leadership is 'About Fooling the Voters',"I have a record of leading with conviction, championing an agenda marked by bold colors, delivering on my promises, and defeating the people who are responsible for our nation's decline. That is the type of leadership we need for all of America. Over the past many months, Casey and I have traveled across the country to deliver a message of hope, that decline is a choice and that we can, in fact, succeed again as a nation. Nobody worked harder, and we left it all out on the field. Now, following our second place finish in Iowa, we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward. If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it. But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign. I'm proud to have delivered on 100% of my promises, and I will not stop now. It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance. They watch his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him. Wife had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci. Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear. I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee and I will honor that pledge. He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackage formed of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.","['record', 'leading', 'conviction', 'championing', 'agenda', 'marked', 'bold', 'colors', 'delivering', 'promises', 'defeating', 'people', 'responsible', 'nations', 'decline', 'type', 'leadership', 'need', 'america', 'past', 'many', 'months', 'casey', 'traveled', 'across', 'country', 'deliver', 'message', 'hope', 'decline', 'choice', 'fact', 'succeed', 'nation', 'nobody', 'worked', 'harder', 'left', 'field', 'following', 'second', 'place', 'finish', 'iowa', 'weve', 'prayed', 'deliberated', 'way', 'forward', 'anything', 'could', 'produce', 'favorable', 'outcome', 'campaign', 'stops', 'interviews', 'would', 'cant', 'ask', 'supporters', 'volunteer', 'time', 'donate', 'resources', 'dont', 'clear', 'path', 'victory', 'accordingly', 'today', 'suspending', 'campaign', 'im', 'proud', 'delivered', '100', 'promises', 'stop', 'clear', 'majority', 'republican', 'primary', 'voters', 'want', 'give', 'donald', 'trump', 'another', 'chance', 'watch', 'presidency', 'get', 'stymied', 'relentless', 'resistance', 'see', 'democrats', 'using', 'lawfare', 'day', 'attack', 'wife', 'disagreements', 'donald', 'trump', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'elevation', 'anthony', 'fauci', 'trump', 'superior', 'current', 'incumbent', 'joe', 'biden', 'clear', 'signed', 'pledge', 'support', 'republican', 'nominee', 'honor', 'pledge', 'endorsement', 'cant', 'go', 'back', 'old', 'republican', 'guard', 'yesteryear', 'repackage', 'formed', 'warmed', 'corporatism', 'nikki', 'haley', 'represents']",0,real,0.22819681722657217

Right. The first time I really came over. You know, I had a whole bunch of weird paranoid suspicions because there was a lot of stuff I couldn't understand. One of the most disturbing problems in our world today is human trafficking, and particularly the trafficking of children. Girls who really wanted it, they could see the possibility for themselves. If only. You take that girl, you put her in school. The Hollywood elite have been making headlines lately due to various controversies involving their members. Right now, it appears that Mel Gibson may have just uncovered one of the biggest secrets involving one of their most important members, Oprah Winfrey, who is one of the world's most renowned figures. Mel has been on a roll lately with all his exposés, and it looks like Oprah is getting caught up in his firestorm next. I do believe is actually happening, is that, first of all, it's triggering a lot of unreleasing. Sound of freedom, Mel Gibson seems to have shed light on some shocking truths about Oprah's alleged involvement in questionable schools in Africa. This revelation has sparked a significant amount of discussion, and people are eager to learn more about what exactly has been exposed. I think it is moving forward. I think that light has definitely been shone into the dark regions, and it's painful, but it's a necessary thing.","['came', 'oh', 'god', 'mid20s', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'really', 'came', 'know', 'whole', 'bunch', 'weird', 'paranoid', 'suspicions', 'lot', 'stuff', 'couldnt', 'understand', 'one', 'disturbing', 'problems', 'world', 'today', 'human', 'trafficking', 'particularly', 'trafficking', 'children', 'girls', 'really', 'wanted', 'could', 'see', 'possibility', 'take', 'girl', 'put', 'school', 'hollywood', 'elite', 'making', 'headlines', 'lately', 'due', 'various', 'controversies', 'involving', 'members', 'right', 'appears', 'mel', 'gibson', 'may', 'uncovered', 'one', 'biggest', 'secrets', 'involving', 'one', 'important', 'members', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'one', 'worlds', 'renowned', 'figures', 'mel', 'roll', 'lately', 'exposs', 'looks', 'like', 'oprah', 'getting', 'caught', 'firestorm', 'next', 'believe', 'actually', 'happening', 'first', 'triggering', 'lot', 'unreleasing', 'sound', 'freedom', 'mel', 'gibson', 'seems', 'shed', 'light', 'shocking', 'truths', 'oprahs', 'alleged', 'involvement', 'questionable', 'schools', 'africa', 'revelation', 'sparked', 'significant', 'amount', 'discussion', 'people', 'eager', 'learn', 'exactly', 'exposed', 'think', 'moving', 'forward', 'think', 'light', 'definitely', 'shone', 'dark', 'regions', 'painful', 'necessary', 'thing']",1,fake,0.597924098411652

Critics point out that instead of fostering genuine debates,  the show has become a one-sided echo chamber, with dissenting opinions often pushed to the sidelines.
Recent events have taken a toll on Goldberg's image as well. The backlash following a series of controversial statements she made on air  left many wondering whether she was truly advocating for open dialogue  or merely trying to stifle opposing viewpoints.  Her insistence on defending her words  rather than reflecting on the harm they may have caused  raised eyebrows among fans and critics alike.
The ultimate reckoning came when it appeared the view was abruptly taken off the air,  leaving many speculating about the reasons behind the show's sudden cancellation. With mounting pressure from both viewers and advertisers, it seems the network had no choice but to pull the plug on a show that had appears to have lost its credibility as a platform for meaningful conversations.  As the dust settles, the public's reaction to Goldberg's alleged downfall is mixed. While some fans remain
steadfast in their support, many are expressing relief that accountability might be finally catching up with the host. Social media has been abuzz with discussions about the need  for a fresh perspective and a more balanced approach on television talk shows. Rumors about a potential replacement for Goldberg on The View have also sparked intense debates. Names of potential hosts are being thrown around, each with their own set of supporters and critics.
The future of the show remains uncertain, but one thing is clear.  Audiences are eager for a change.  I hope she is held accountable for her actions.  She and the others on The View have been non-caring and one-sided and downright cruel. It's time to be held accountable, one fan commented. We live in a time where talk show hosts, news readers, actors, entertainers, and sports people around the world think their opinion matters more than yours.
This is what happens when fame goes to their heads and they are given a platform to spew their ideologies.  Sue her for every last penny she has. This is the only way to teach them all that they will be next if they don't sit down and shut up. An enraged fan added, while another fan wrote, she needs this.  She's defamed too many people,  usually identifying people as racist with absolutely no evidence whatsoever. Though painful, this will be good for her.
She needs to be held accountable for defaming people due to nothing more than her own hate. This behavior modification is way, way overdue. Anyway, that's it for this video folks.

You don't think it's racist if somebody turns to the leader of the free country and says, can you park my car? You know, is it racist? Do you think it's racism? I don't know. I have a black kid I raised, Whoopi. I have a kid in my house. That is not the same thing. You don't have to be black to know what racism is. Yes, you do. No, you don't. Yes, you do, baby. No, you do not. Gather around, folks, because Rosie O'Donnell just spilled some major tea during her jaw-dropping appearance on Brooke Shields' podcast, Now What? If you thought daytime talk shows were all about camaraderie and discussions, think again. Rosie didn't hold back one bit as she took a stroll down the memory lane of her tumultuous time on the iconic show, The View.
Taking a stroll down memory lane, Rosie harked back to her entry into the daytime talk show in 2006. She didn't hesitate to hint that the show's dynamics weren't exactly harmonious. She didn't name names but subtly indicated that Elizabeth Hasselbeck was a prominent player in the melodrama. Moreover, she hinted at a mysterious figure pulling the strings, referring to the show being less about women's voices and more about the directives of a certain white male CIS producer, the late Bill Getty. but the real juicy bits were reserved for her interactions with the current host, Whoopi Goldberg. Rosie's narrative took a turn as she revealed her initial exit was a result of her clashes with Hasselbeck, but upon her return, it was Whoopi who emerged as the thorn in her side.

But hold onto your seats because Rosie isn't holding back on the truth, the kind that keeps tabloids churning and fans glued to their screens. She candidly spilled the beans about their weirdness, a term that leaves a trail of question marks hanging in the air.
I don't know if it's jealousy, competition, or the fact that she said a mean thing about me once that really hurt my feelings, she said. O'Donnell also noted that DeGeneres told her, I'm really sorry and I don't remember that, regarding the upsetting remark on their friendship, adding that she believed the 65-year-old television personality must have seen her talk about the situation on Andy Cohen's show last September. I remembered it so well, she added. I had t-shirts printed and I gave them to my staff that said, I don't know Rosie, we're not friends. I have a picture of her holding Parker, she said, referring to her 28-year-old son, who had been an infant at the time the picture was taken. I know her mother. I could identify her brother without her in the room. I knew her for so many years. It just felt like I don't trust this person to be in my world.
In any case, the charismatic host of The View has charmed her way into the hearts of millions over the years, but recent events have unveiled a darker side to her that many never saw coming.

From her outspoken views on politics to her questionable handling of sensitive topics, the cracks in her facade have become too glaring to ignore.

So apparently, even if the kids went to school,  they were sent back home early while their parents were still at work.  Not only that, but other local, intermediate, and elementary schools were supposed to reopen after the summer break the following day. This was another reason why more kids were at their residences instead of schools.
As soon as the news of the missing children went viral on social media,  netizens have been spinning conspiracy theories  with many thinking that the schools were deliberately shut.  Some claim that the elites had finally been able to get kids without people noticing while others claimed that it must have been a big sacrifice. accounts from parents whose children are missing started to pour in on social media,  making netizens believe that there's some conspiracy behind so many lost kids.
and schools being canceled or postponed on the day of the fire.  One case was of teenager Cairo Fuentes who stayed back at home with his pet dog in La Jena while his adoptive parents were out for work miles away.  They told CBS News how their son was enjoying his last day of summer vacation  days before his  15th birthday.  And as per their accounts from the day, as soon as they heard of the fire, they tried to rush back home but got stuck in traffic.
Finally, when the parents reached home, were allegedly stopped by police barricades and weirdly while their house had scorched to the ground,  first responders reportedly told them that the area was cleared and nobody was there.  Two days later, when they were finally allowed to go back home,  they discovered the bodies of their son hugging the family dog, both dead.

Follow me ❤️❤️❤️,2023-10-16 18:13:16,Jada Pinkett Smith 'Panics' as Her 'Sickening' Role in Maui Fires Leaks,"In addition to all the drama, Jada also reveals that their marriage had been on the rocks for years. Back in 2016, she says they were exhausted with trying to make their marriage work and they weren't comfortable sharing this to the public. But although they are separated, she clarifies that the pair are not legally divorcing. Surprisingly, Jada also claims in her autobiography that Chris Rock asked her out while he believed she was divorcing him and that she initially believed Will's decision to attack him at the Oscars
was just a skit.  It's a full 180 moment from last year's drama when most of us found Will Smith to be problematic.  Chris, I apologize to you.  My behavior  was  unacceptable  and I'm here whenever you're ready to talk.  Little did we know the amount of pain he's been hiding, right? Not only Will Smith fans are reacting to this,  even important names.
Jada's responses have ignited revelations that it might have damaged the box office star's reputation, according to TV personality, Stephen A. Smith. The first take host commented heavily, starting with, let me tell y'all what Will Smith does not deserve. He does not deserve what Jada Pinkett Smith has done to him. Jada Pinkett Smith is making,  she's making news because she's out on the circuit,  media circuit,  promoting her new book, Worthy.
Jada's career might come to an end if she doesn't clarify the things she has been saying. Maybe we'll find answers in her memoir, or not. Also, did you know that Will also made his own biography back in 2021? It was praised as brave and inspiring and gave the idea that they were a close couple. And he even claimed, our marriage has never experienced adultery in a TV appearance last year. Jada and I discuss everything and we have never ever surprised one another.
Jada has been sending mixed signals to her husband and even the public for years,  whether it's about having other partners while they were married or dismissing her affair with her son, Jaden's buddy, who was 25 years younger  as an entanglement.  It's starting to look like she doesn't want any responsibility regarding anything.  So the million dollar question is,  is she doing all of this for clout?  Is she revealing things one by one to sell her book?  After all, the Smith's life has always been a topic of fascination for many people.
That's all for now.

But wait, it gets even juicier.  Brace yourselves for the big reveal. The People's Fund of Maui, it turns out, is owned and operated by the Entertainment Industry Foundation, EIF, a nonprofit organization with close ties to, you guessed it, the entertainment industry. That's right, folks.
The charity we all thought was going to help the needy citizens of Maui is actually in bed with the Hollywood elite. Once this bombshell was dropped, the rumor mill went into overdrive and questions about transparency and ethics started flooding in. But here's where it gets really scandalous.  The fat cat executives over at EIF seem to be living the high life while the rest of us are left wondering where the alleged $10 million went.  In fact, some people are convinced that the donations made to the People's Fund of Maui might not even get to the intended recipients.
You see, reports came crashing down, revealing that the president of EIF is raking in a hefty salary north of $400,000 a year. The CEO isn't far behind, pocketing over $300,000 annually. And let's not forget the CFO, casually stashing away more than $290,000 each year, not to mention the 29 other individuals on EIF's payroll who are laughing all the way to the bank with salaries exceeding $100,000 each year.
These 13 top tier executives are collectively rolling in a mind boggling $3.2 million. While the lower level workers, the ones actually doing the charities heavy lifting, are left to scrape by on an average of approximately $64,527 per year.  Now, if that doesn't make you shake your head in disbelief, I don't know what will. The glaring disconnect between EIF's lavish executive salaries and the paltry $1,200  being doled out to those in need through the People's Fund of Maui,
is enough to make anyone's blood boil.  It's no wonder the public has begun to wonder whether Dwayne and Oprah's supposed act of charity was nothing more than a slick publicity stunt designed to keep them in the spotlight.  Critics argue that the real winners in this scheme are the executives running EIF,  while the victims of the Hawaii wildfire are left high and dry.  As the scandal continues to unfold, it's prompted a broader conversation about the true nature of nonprofit organizations.
especially those with executives living the high life on donors' hard-earned cash.  Are these organizations genuinely committed to supporting those in need,  or are they just elaborate schemes to further line the pockets of the rich and famous?  In the midst of this growing controversy, some outspoken advocates are encouraging individuals to sidestep the shady dealings of celebrity-backed nonprofits  and donate directly to those in need through independent platforms.

There had actually been a news article on celebrities painting their houses a weird shade of blue and now the public is speculating that they must have planned everything ahead of time. While others are questioning the fires over land, others are claiming that the elites wanted something more than just land. They wanted something that they could not get without the fire and that is the children.  This conspiracists are alleging that since most of the people who have yet to be found in the fires are children,  those children might have been taken.  In a deeply concerning development, the Hawaii State Department of Education has reported that 2,025 students remain unaccounted for in the Lahaina public school system  following the devastating fire on August 8th in Lahaina, Maui.  This has made the public question why some kids were at school while others were home, but it seems that the fire coincided with the first day back at school for many students.  Schools had been closed due to an outage, leaving many children home alone.  The tragedy has ignited a firestorm of criticism directed at Hawaii's state government,  particularly Governor Josh Green, for perceived inadequacies in emergency response and preparedness.  The absence of warning sirens and a perceived lack of an official response to the disaster have drawn widespread condemnation.  While the cause of the fires hasn't been determined, Hawaiian Electric,  the major power company on Maui is under scrutiny for not shutting down power lines when high winds created dangerous fire conditions.  Hawaiian Electric previously said both the company and the state are conducting investigations into what happened.  Meanwhile, the conspiracy theories have become so widespread that Hawaiian officials have addressed them with the office of Governor Josh Green saying in a statement,  there is no truth to the horrendous assertion that the fires were deliberately set to raise the historic town of Lahaina,  which was the first capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom.  But who knows, there has to be some truth they could tell instead of trying to keep everything secret.  A fan on Twitter said,  Oprah's land in upcountry near Kula has a huge underground facility with tones of concrete. She has been building it for years.  Tom Hanks is reported to own a home in Maui also,  along with Steven Tyler, Lars Ulrich and Woody Harrelson. Or it's just a coincidence.  Another said everyone, including Tom Hanks, who had their Maui house painted blue was in this hit job. They knew it was coming. They had foreknowledge, which is a big issue in illegal action.

We support victims.  We have done this historically through our work and will continue to do so in the future. A couple of months ago, Danny's family reached out to us and they asked us to write character letters to represent the person that we knew for 25 years so that the judge could take that into full consideration relative to the sentencing. The letters were not written to question the legitimacy of the judicial system or the validity of the jury's ruling. They were intended for the judge to read and not to undermine the testimony of the victims or re-traumatize them in any way, we would never want to do that.  And we're sorry if that has taken place.

CBS's national environmental correspondent David Schechter has the details. It's a sobering study and could have profound health implications on the way we consume water. Scientists at Columbia and Rutgers now say an average liter of bottled water contains nearly a quarter million particles of nanoplastics, each the fraction of the width  of a human hair. There's been a wealth of research on larger microplastics, much of which end up in oceans breaking down into tiny fragments. A potential environmental nightmare, but the World Health Organization has called the medical risk low.  But with nanoplastics...  Do you think there is a reason for concern? Yes, when they are getting into the nano size, can potentially, can get into the blood and then they are can... being transported to the vital organs. The particles there can actually bypass the cells of the GI system. The International Bottled Water Association says there's no scientific consensus on potential health impacts, and media reports do nothing more than unnecessarily scare consumers. Have you changed your own personal use of water bottles after learning this? I intentionally cut down my water, I mean, bottled water consumption maybe by  half. These scientists recommend consumers use tap water to fill up aluminum bottles as a safer alternative.

The world really did shift to bottled water after a lot of conspiracy theorists said that, you know, tap water was contaminated. But this is probably not true because of the recent developments
bottled water. Nanoplastics have previously been linked to cancer, fertility problems and birth defects. Scientists actually used a very advanced laser scanning technique and found on average 240,000 tiny bits of plastic particles in one litre of bottled water. That's compared to about 5.5 per one litre of tap water. So tap water apparently is a lot safer than bottled water.
Scientists did also say they will have to do a lot more testing to see you know how dangerous this really is You know nanoplastics to our system because we do actually flush out naturally a lot of the nanoplastics But what's left? That's what they're really concerned about So they will need to do a lot more testing to see how dangerous or if you know at all It is dangerous.

Today we're going to be uncovering the death of Avici. He was sacrificed. If you look up the actual meaning of Avici, it means lowest level in hell. If you didn't know that, I want you to share this with three people. He was a well known, sweetest DJ who got his start in the industry at the age of 16. After he began posting remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal. Avichi released Wake me up in 2013, which had major success and he became a superstar DJ. Next to Calvin Harris and Martin Garricks, he helped bridge the gap between electronic and country music in his career. As time went on, he began to look more skinny and frail. Drugs were a big part of his life. On April 20, 2018, news of Avicis's death dominated the media all over the world. When he was found dead in Olman while he was on vacation, it took his family six days to announce that his cause of death was suicide. There were claims that he was unhappy, but the truth is he was very happy, in love with his girlfriend and he even extended his vacation. There was no suicide ever declared by a coroner, only by his family. He was murdered. Something very suspicious is that Iici suffered massive blood loss from a broken glass bottle. Before he died, there was word in the industry he was going to expose the pedophile ring in Hollywood, at least one of them. You can see that in his video For a Better Day.","['hello', 'everybody', 'welcome', 'exposing', 'hollywood', 'today', 'going', 'uncovering', 'death', 'avici', 'sacrificed', 'look', 'actual', 'meaning', 'avici', 'means', 'lowest', 'level', 'hell', 'didnt', 'know', 'want', 'share', 'three', 'people', 'well', 'known', 'sweetest', 'dj', 'got', 'start', 'industry', 'age', '16', 'began', 'posting', 'remixes', 'electronic', 'music', 'forums', 'led', 'first', 'record', 'deal', 'avichi', 'released', 'wake', '2013', 'major', 'success', 'became', 'superstar', 'dj', 'next', 'calvin', 'harris', 'martin', 'garricks', 'helped', 'bridge', 'gap', 'electronic', 'country', 'music', 'career', 'time', 'went', 'began', 'look', 'skinny', 'frail', 'drugs', 'big', 'part', 'life', 'april', '20', '2018', 'news', 'aviciss', 'death', 'dominated', 'media', 'world', 'found', 'dead', 'olman', 'vacation', 'took', 'family', 'six', 'days', 'announce', 'cause', 'death', 'suicide', 'claims', 'unhappy', 'truth', 'happy', 'love', 'girlfriend', 'even', 'extended', 'vacation', 'suicide', 'ever', 'declared', 'coroner', 'family', 'murdered', 'something', 'suspicious', 'iici', 'suffered', 'massive', 'blood', 'loss', 'broken', 'glass', 'bottle', 'died', 'word', 'industry', 'going', 'expose', 'pedophile', 'ring', 'hollywood', 'least', 'one', 'see', 'video', 'better', 'day']",1,real,0.45920298649174135

Today, Jupiter locals reacting to the news, many calling the incident concerning  causing them to reevaluate taking kids to similar areas. Does it make you think about safety? Absolutely,  because you assume it's a safe place because it's a public area. You assume it's safe.

Observe the oversized dentures, a peculiar feature that sets her apart from the rest of the creatures in this swamp. Listen closely, for you may hear the characteristic lip-smacking as she navigates her way through the treacherous waters of bureaucracy. 

But what truly distinguishes the drunken sea hag is her uncanny ability to engage in insider trading, a practice that can spell doom for the integrity of our great nation. As she maneuvers through the swampy terrain of Washington, her actions cast ripples that affect the entire world. 

As we witness this disgusting creature in its natural habitat, we are reminded of the delicate balance that must be maintained to protect the integrity of this unique ecosystem.

I want to pause in a defense  of  words.
Words  matter.
And yes,  the words by politicians offering thoughts and prayers after  grief  matter a little bit.  The politicians' actions matter more. But words continue to matter.  Words of  comfort and solace  offered to grieving families.
Words of support.
Words of people saying,  not in the Canada we want to build.
just as negative words matter.
twisted  rants on the internet  and in social media filled with misinformation, disinformation designed  to undermine people's confidence in their neighbours, in their society.  Designed to turn us one against the other. Those are words.  And they can lead to terrible,  terrible consequences as  we all know are all too well.  But the words that counter  that hatred.
Words of  presence, of comfort.  Words of facts fighting disinformation.
Words to a co-worker, as Ed said,  that says something  unthinkingly  harmful.  Words heard around the dinner table that need to be responded to with stronger words.  We are in a society, we are a world that communicates  with words.  And each of us wields the responsibility  to speak up.
when we hear something that betrays a misunderstanding  of the core values  and the core direction that Canada needs to take of  openness,  respect.  And can I pause for a second  saying,  let's not ask for tolerance?  There are places in the world where  a little tolerance would go a long way, but can we get beyond that in Canada?

of violence,
of genocide,
of indigenous people.
And our Canada is a place where Muslims aren't safe.
They aren't.
They aren't safe.
Muslims are not safe in this country.
And Muslims wonder,
I've spoken to people,
they wonder how many more lives will it take?
How many more families will be mauled,
mauled down the street?
How many more families will be killed
before we do something?
Innocent people were killed while praying
in a place of prayer,
in a masjid,
in a mosque in Quebec.
Gunned down.
A man was. Was a Muslim man in Toronto
was knifed and killed.
And both of those incidents we know very clearly
that it was directly because of hate.
It was because of hate.
There was so much hate
towards someone that they did not know.
Just because of who they were,
because of how they prayed,
because of what they look like.
That is a reality.
People live with that everyday.
They walk the streets
wondering if I will be attacked
just because the way I look,
not because of it.
Of an enemy that I have,
not because of someone who's got a problem with me.
Will I be Attacked today
just because the way I look,
that is a real question people ask.
We know, and this is a harsh reality.
Politicians have used Islamophobia for political gain.
They have. They have used it as a divisive tool.
That has to end.
No one can ever use Islamophobia for a political gain.
And we all know when it's been done,
we all know how it's happened.
And I'm not saying that it's solely
those politicians have used,
who have used Islamophobia for Political Gain
who are to blame.
Absolutely not.
But you are surely a part of the problem.
If you have used Islamophobia for political gain,
thinking I can divide people and get votes.
This is the result of it.
This is what happens when you divide people.
You've in flame, hatred,
and people die.
That's what happens to all, uh,
the Muslim community right now in Canada
that are suffering right now,
that are feeling pain right now.
I feel your pain.
I understand your pain.
And we are going to work towards
making sure that you do not have to live in fear,
that you do not have to walk the streets in fear.

Put a raw egg into the cup, then fill the cup with vinegar. Wait 24 hours to remove the eggs. At this point, just rub the egg shell and it will disappear.  You get a bouncy egg. Pour baking soda into the cup. Add water to the cup. After stirring evenly, dip a cotton swab into soda water. Write on card, then smear the card with grape juice. This way the words you write will appear. Take out a PVC pipe. Rub it into your hair or shirt, then put it next to the water pipe. The water will flow in the direction of the PVC pipe.  Put gallium into hot water. Soon you'll have a puddle of liquid metal, and it is safe and non-toxic.
Pour vinegar into sandwich bag. Then add baking soda and seal it. Soon the bag will explode. Put a hole punched bottle cap in the middle of the DD. Then put the inflated balloon on the bottle cap. This way you get a land hovercraft. Keep twisting an empty bottle. It's not done until it can't be twisted anymore. Now unscrew the bottle cap. It will shoot out like a cannonball. Put baking soda in the balloon. Then pour the vinegar into the bottle. Then put the balloon on the mouth of the bottle. Pour the baking soda from the balloon into the bottle. The balloon will slowly start to grow bigger. This is because there is a chemical reaction inside. Follow the above. Rubber gloves will also slowly start to get bigger. Isn't it interesting?

These aquatic denizens have shown evidence of intelligence far advanced for their kind. They navigate their environment with a level of cognition that rivals that of some mammals, exhibiting complex social behaviors and problem solving skills.

And no, this is not the same fifth wheel that you are going on dates with two different couples. But regardless, this technology came out in the 1930s and cut out in about the 1950s. It was used to parallel park cars in the big city that couldn't really fit into all those tight spaces. The man shown in this video is Brooks Walker. He made use of that little spare compartment back there to use it as the fifth wheel. And as you saw, he just kind of pulls a lever and the fifth wheel drops down. This was back all the way in 1933, though. Guys. Like, when I saw this, I was genuinely astonished. And then he made it even better. In the 50s, he used hydraulic pumps and gears, and instead of having to pull lever, you just click the button and you could use it in almost all cars. But when he took this new version to Detroit, they unfortunately said no. Now, the question I can't seem to answer is why the hell this never caught on?

This is the disulfide bond. Put two bottle caps on a round magnet, pat a glass plate. Then rotate the gyroscope and then slowly draw off the glass plate. The gyroscope will be suspended in the air to turn up. This is the magnetic levitation as shown in the video. The coins cross each other and stacked on the edge of the table. Slowly push the coins by hand. The coins did not fall down. This is the principle of the evil coin pusher. Put a spoon under the faucet and slowly draw hearts in the water with your finger and the water flow becomes the shape of a heart. You can't stick a straw through a potato. Just pinch the tip of the straw with your hand and the potato is surprisingly pierced. Put toilet paper into a cup. Then put the cup upside down in the water. Take out the cup, but the toilet paper is not soaked. Tear off the matches and the rubbing paper on the side. When lit, it will leave brown oil stains. Apply it on your fingers. Gently rub it to produce white smoke. This is the secret of the magician. Empty hand to produce smoke.","['magic', 'real', 'science', 'experiment', 'put', 'steel', 'wool', 'circle', 'put', 'cell', 'phone', 'middle', 'dial', 'phone', 'steel', 'wool', 'instantly', 'sparks', 'radiation', 'cell', 'phone', 'call', 'cut', 'straw', 'fill', 'water', 'add', 'two', 'cups', 'pump', 'water', 'one', 'cup', 'siphon', 'phenomenon', 'wrap', 'paper', 'clip', 'around', 'pencil', 'shape', 'throw', 'hot', 'water', 'instantly', 'return', 'original', 'shape', 'charm', 'memory', 'metal', 'toggle', 'ruler', 'shade', 'move', 'quickly', 'put', 'bright', 'light', 'toggle', 'becomes', 'wavy', 'motion', 'magic', 'jelly', 'effect', 'add', 'baking', 'soda', 'cup', 'white', 'vinegar', 'cup', 'pour', 'generated', 'gas', 'another', 'empty', 'cup', 'invisible', 'gas', 'actually', 'douse', 'two', 'rows', 'burning', 'candles', 'principle', 'fire', 'extinguisher', 'easily', 'lift', 'yolk', 'egg', 'touching', 'garlic', 'hand', 'disulfide', 'bond', 'put', 'two', 'bottle', 'caps', 'round', 'magnet', 'pat', 'glass', 'plate', 'rotate', 'gyroscope', 'slowly', 'draw', 'glass', 'plate', 'gyroscope', 'suspended', 'air', 'turn', 'magnetic', 'levitation', 'shown', 'video', 'coins', 'cross', 'stacked', 'edge', 'table', 'slowly', 'push', 'coins', 'hand', 'coins', 'fall', 'principle', 'evil', 'coin', 'pusher', 'put', 'spoon', 'faucet', 'slowly', 'draw', 'hearts', 'water', 'finger', 'water', 'flow', 'becomes', 'shape', 'heart', 'cant', 'stick', 'straw', 'potato', 'pinch', 'tip', 'straw', 'hand', 'potato', 'surprisingly', 'pierced', 'put', 'toilet', 'paper', 'cup', 'put', 'cup', 'upside', 'water', 'take', 'cup', 'toilet', 'paper', 'soaked', 'tear', 'matches', 'rubbing', 'paper', 'side', 'lit', 'leave', 'brown', 'oil', 'stains', 'apply', 'fingers', 'gently', 'rub', 'produce', 'white', 'smoke', 'secret', 'magician', 'empty', 'hand', 'produce', 'smoke']",1,fake,0.5217167539295026

Make a circle of steel wool, put a cell phone in it, dial the phone. The steel wool sparks instantly. This is the radiation from a cell phone call. Touch the garlic with your hand. 

You can easily lift the yolk. This is the disulfide bond. Draw a circle in the pan with the garlic. The eggs will come out round. Sprinkle a little salt on the table. You'll be able to stand the egg. 

Fold five toothpicks in half and lay them together. Put a few drops of water in the center. The toothpicks become five-pointed stars. That's the tension of water. There's no way you can get a straw through a potato. 

Seal the tip of the straw with your thumb, and you poke it, and the potato is broken through. That's the power of compressed air. Pouring sprite into a wilted rose. Roses magically come back to life. 

Pour sand into a pie pan. Shake it well. Put a small magnetic ball. The ball starts to draw in the sand. Add baking soda and a cup of white vinegar to the cup. Pour the resulting gas into an empty cup. 

This invisible gas was able to extinguish a burning candle. This is how a fire extinguisher works. You crush a match head into powder. Pour it into a lock that won't open. Stick a match in it. Light it. 

Wait for the match to reach the hole. The lock magically opens. Simulate a rocket launch. All you need is a match. Break the match and roll it in tin foil. Pull out the matchstick. Put it on the launching pad. 

Ignite and fire. Place three bottle caps on the circular magnet. Put another piece of glass to spin the gyroscope. Remove the base plate. The gyroscope is suspended. This is a magnetic levitation battery.

There was a lot of skepticism going on right now whether that's a UFO or UAP. People were blaming that it's just ball lightning.

It comes after the governor and local officials pledged to crack down on crime that has forced so many stores to close down. 

Our crime reporter Henry Leedswin is just now live. He's at SFPD headquarters with the latest Henry. Happened again. Four women run off after stealing from the CBS pharmacy at Van Ness and Jackson in San Francisco, this time just before 6 Monday night. 

It's the latest grab-and-go crime in San Francisco that's forced many drugstores in the city to close. The man who took this video tells me he feels sorry for the workers who have lost their jobs or have had their hours reduced because of what he called out-of-control shoplifting. 

Organized retail theft has become such a hot-button issue that it's now a point of focus in the upcoming gubernatorial recall election. Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulkner spoke outside the shuttered Walgreens at Larkin and Bush in San Francisco, blasting the governor. 

A governor who has supported the lessening of laws when it comes to stealing items under $950, lowering those consequences. At a news conference last week, Newsom said he signed a new law that maintains task forces across the state that crack down on retail theft. 

San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott supports the legislation. When they see these things go viral, the perception of lawlessness, the perception that anything goes, really, that has to be overcome too. 

Now, three of the top cities for organized retail theft in the United States are in California. LA is number one, San Francisco's number five, and Sacramento is number 10. Reporting live at SAPD headquarters, Henry Lee, KTVU, Fox Studios.

He chooses not to believe it because it's an uncomfortable truth.
The other option is he actually didn't get the information at all because the reporting says he doesn't read the book and he only gets oral briefings two or three times a week.

And that reason is Jeffrey Epstein. Melinda has shared with Gail that Bill's frequent visits to Pito island were a part of the reason why she divorced him. She did not approve of his relationship with Jeffrey and made it known. She said when she first met Jeffrey he was evil personified. Here is a clip of the interview. It's very interesting. A friendship or business or some kind of contact with Jeffrey Epstein and that you were not that that was very upsetting to you. Did that play a role in the divorce at all in this process? Yeah, as I said, it's not one thing. It was many things. But I did not like that he'd had meetings with jffrey Epstein know. And you made that clear to him. I made that clear to him.I also met Jeffrey Epstein it exactly one time. Did you? Yes, because I wanted to see who this man was and I regretted it from the second I stepped in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified. I had nightmares about it afterwards. So you know, my heart breaks for these young women because that's how I felt. And here I'm an older woman. My God, I feel terrible for those young women. Was awful. You felt that the moment you walked. I didn't hear. Was awful. Yeah. And you shared that with Bill and he still continued to spend time with him. Any of the questions remaining about what Bill'relationship there was those are for Bill to answer. Oay. But I made it very clear how I felt about him. How would you describe your relationship with Bill Gates today? I don't even know if relationship is the right word. I don't know the word. Well, we certainly have a working relationship. Right. And I would say we're friendlye at this point. Friends. Friends is a different word for me.

So over here, we have individuals who are not particularly fundamentalists, not particularly religious. And you can see there's a much reduced.
expression of this particular gene, the BMAT2 gene. Another evidence that supports our hypothesis for the development of this approach.
So our hypothesis is that these are fanatical people, that they have over-expression of the BMAT2 gene, and that by vaccinating them against this will eliminate this behavior. So we have some very, very remarkable data in this next slide. Here we have two.
These are FMRIs. These are two different individuals with different levels of expression of VMAT2. On top is an individual who's a religious fanatic and individual, and we've repeated this numerous times, that has high levels of VMAT2. Now, this individual down here who had low levels of the VMAT2 gene, this individual would...
self-describe as not particularly religious. In each case, these individuals were read a religious text. This individual lit up.
the right middle frontal gyrus shown here. And that's a part of the brain that's associated with theory of mind. It's a part of the brain that has to do with intents and beliefs and desires. In contrast, in more contrast, here's an individual who would not particularly self-describe as religious. And when they're read a religious text, what you see is that this part of the brain called the
anterior insula lights up. This is a part of the brain that's associated with disgust or displeasure on hearing something.

It ended with Jenkins getting shot in the mouth, the bullet lacerating his tongue, breaking his jaw and exiting out of his neck. For months, there was a lot of doubt about the official count of what took place. The Mississippi Department of Public Safety releasing a statement the day after the incident saying only
The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is investigating an officer involved shooting, but that didn't encapsulate the horror. In July, I spoke to Parker,  and Jenkins' mother and toured the home where the crimes occurred. I crawled here to this spot and they started beating me here and tasing me. As you can see, blood spots and all, and my blood spots there. Jenkins' injuries make it difficult for him to speak. It hurts.  I'm embarrassed.
Has anyone from the department ever reached out to you and  apologized? Have they ever asked for anything at all? Rankin County Sheriff Ryan Bailey spoke at a press conference about the incident in late June. I believe in my heart that this department remains one of the best departments in our state and I'm committed to doing everything in my power to keep this department on a correct path moving forward. Yesterday he issued an apology and said  he didn't fully understand the gravity of the crimes committed until recently.
Federal authorities begin their review in February. They, along with the state of Mississippi, were able to secure guilty pleas of all accused. Not only did they brazenly commit these acts, but after inflicting serious bodily injury by firing a shot through one of the victim's mouths, they left him lying in a pool of blood, gathered on the porch of the house to discuss how to cover it up. What indifference.
what disregard  for life. A life that will never be the same for either of these two men. It's hard to stay right here knowing what happened right here. Justice is it all boils down to. I'm just like them,  whether they're in uniform or not.
Very tough to listen to. The officers pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges, including conspiracy against rights and deprivation of rights under the color of law. When you sat there and talked to those two men, you understood how frustrated they were. They were trying to get anyone to listen to them about this. And for a while, no one was listening. In fact, media coverage was really small at one point. And then the idea that now they have this moment, they have a moment of truth  and you hear about this, the torture that he endured. It's almost impossible to understand talking to law enforcement officials across the country.

Children are, we're talking about necklaces. Of course. up and they're shooting children. It's a terrible situation and what we need to be thinking about is what to do about that. And what disturbs me Mr.
What disturbs me, and I will try not to be disturbed, is not merely your policy. Remember, I'm a taxpayer. I remember you're a because I'm Secretary of State, can't kick me around. I'm a taxpayer. I understand that, Mr. Chairman. I understand that. But I want to tell you something.
What disturbs me more than the policy that you call a policy is the rationale for the policy. The rationale for the policy. You set out four principles that you adhere to. And then you, and I will go over them in a moment. Then you say on page 14, we must not become part of South Africa's problem. We must remain part of their solution. We must not aim to impose ourselves, our solutions, our favorites in South Africa. Damn it, we have favorites in South Africa.
The favorites in South Africa are the people who are being repressed by that ugly white regime. We have favorites. Our loyalty is not to South Africa, it's to South Africans. And the South Africans are majority black and they are being excoriated. It is not to some stupid puppet government over there. It is not to the Afrikaner's regime. We have no loyalty to them. We have no loyalty to South Africa, to South Africans.
And the fact of the matter is, I mean, I listen to this rationale first of all. It is the leaders of South Africa and their people, black and white, who have the majority responsibility. They must rise to it. Well, they are rising to it. They're rising to it. The only thing left available to them is that repulsive, repugnant regime of Afrikaners there. And it's the only way they have. They've tried everything for the last 20 years. They begged, they borrowed, they crawled. And now they're taking up arms. The second thing.
Progress toward peace requires a timetable. Timetable, elimination of apartheid, what's our timetable? What are we saying to that repugnant regime? Are we saying you've got 20 days, 20 months, 20 years? We ask them to put up a timetable, what's our timetable? Where do we stand morally? Thirdly.
Black South Africans, the choices before black South Africans are equally clear. We call on them to avoid easy descent into violence, terrorism, and extremism. To demonstrate by their action they understand the need for compromise. Hell, they've tried to compromise for 20 years. They've tried everything. Everything in their power. And look what's happened to them. They're being crushed.","['whether', 'agree', 'frustration', 'must', 'feel', 'im', 'surprised', 'hadnt', 'said', 'course', 'feels', 'frustration', 'feel', 'frustration', 'people', 'dying', 'people', 'dying', 'feel', 'frustration', 'theyre', 'dying', 'theyre', 'shot', 'children', 'talking', 'necklaces', 'course', 'theyre', 'shooting', 'children', 'terrible', 'situation', 'need', 'thinking', 'disturbs', 'mr', 'disturbs', 'try', 'disturbed', 'merely', 'policy', 'remember', 'im', 'taxpayer', 'remember', 'youre', 'im', 'secretary', 'state', 'cant', 'kick', 'around', 'im', 'taxpayer', 'understand', 'mr', 'chairman', 'understand', 'want', 'tell', 'something', 'disturbs', 'policy', 'call', 'policy', 'rationale', 'policy', 'rationale', 'policy', 'set', 'four', 'principles', 'adhere', 'go', 'moment', 'say', 'page', '14', 'must', 'become', 'part', 'south', 'africas', 'problem', 'must', 'remain', 'part', 'solution', 'must', 'aim', 'impose', 'solutions', 'favorites', 'south', 'africa', 'damn', 'favorites', 'south', 'africa', 'favorites', 'south', 'africa', 'people', 'repressed', 'ugly', 'white', 'regime', 'favorites', 'loyalty', 'south', 'africa', 'south', 'africans', 'south', 'africans', 'majority', 'black', 'excoriated', 'stupid', 'puppet', 'government', 'afrikaners', 'regime', 'loyalty', 'loyalty', 'south', 'africa', 'south', 'africans', 'fact', 'matter', 'mean', 'listen', 'rationale', 'first', 'leaders', 'south', 'africa', 'people', 'black', 'white', 'majority', 'responsibility', 'must', 'rise', 'well', 'rising', 'theyre', 'rising', 'thing', 'left', 'available', 'repulsive', 'repugnant', 'regime', 'afrikaners', 'way', 'theyve', 'tried', 'everything', 'last', '20', 'years', 'begged', 'borrowed', 'crawled', 'theyre', 'taking', 'arms', 'second', 'thing', 'progress', 'toward', 'peace', 'requires', 'timetable', 'timetable', 'elimination', 'apartheid', 'whats', 'timetable', 'saying', 'repugnant', 'regime', 'saying', 'youve', 'got', '20', 'days', '20', 'months', '20', 'years', 'ask', 'put', 'timetable', 'whats', 'timetable', 'stand', 'morally', 'thirdly', 'black', 'south', 'africans', 'choices', 'black', 'south', 'africans', 'equally', 'clear', 'call', 'avoid', 'easy', 'descent', 'violence', 'terrorism', 'extremism', 'demonstrate', 'action', 'understand', 'need', 'compromise', 'hell', 'theyve', 'tried', 'compromise', '20', 'years', 'theyve', 'tried', 'everything', 'everything', 'power', 'look', 'whats', 'happened', 'theyre', 'crushed']",0,real,0.48761206446994937

The former governor of New Jersey dropped out of the race in New Hampshire. You saw it there.

And by some estimates, you're head by an average of 14 in the real clear politics average polling in New Hampshire. In New Hampshire. So if that 12 goes to Nikki Haley, she could give you a run for your money there. Well, you know, you have Democrats in New Hampshire and they vote, and you have independence in New Hampshire in large numbers and they vote. And I have polls that show me leading by a tremendous amount in New Hampshire and a lot in Iowa and nationwide, we'leading by almost 60 points. So I'm not exactly worried about it. I understand New Hampshire very well. I've won it twice and did very well with New Hampshire. I love the people, they love me. I think we did a good job for New Hampshire economically and even from the standpoint of the military taking care of the vets. And I think we're going to do very well in New Hampshire now. You know, Chris Christie was in and he got a hot mic. I heard about. I thought actually the bigger story wasn't the fact that he dropped out. Nobody cared too much about that. But he had a hot mic where he was talking to somebody about the weather and he happened to say that she doesn't have what it takes. She'll be creamed in the. In the election. And I mean, I know her very well, and I happen to believe that Chris Christie is right. That's one of the few things he's been right about, actually. So you don't think it changes the dynamic much? I don't know if it does or not. Look, we're winning tremendously here. We re. I think we're 20, 24 points up.

Because you couldn't get them from the rhinos. Mitch McConnell, these guys, you couldn't get it.

They wouldn't give it. And now they end up giving trillions of dollars to this character Biden.
And he goes around saying, we'll build a bridge, we'll build whatever you want, you know, trying to buy votes, but it's not working because they are down the tubes. What it is doing is causing tremendous inflation. That's what that does. And that's what's happening in our country, and that's what's killing so many families. I also got Mexico to give us 28,000 soldiers.
And, you know, free of charge. I said to the president of Mexico, we have to get you to give US soldiers to guard our border while I'm building the border wall.

Our ancestors built the most exceptional republic.
ever to exist in all of human history  and we are making it greater than ever  before.
This is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.  We are Americans,  we are pioneers,  we are the pathfinders.  We settled the New World,  we built the modern world,  and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth  that everyone is made equal  by the hand  of Almighty God.
America is the place where anything can happen.  America is the place where anyone can rise.  And here,  on this land, on this soil,  on this continent,  the most incredible dreams come true.  This nation  is our canvas,  and this country  is our masterpiece.  We look at tomorrow  and see unlimited frontiers
just waiting to be explored.  Our brightest discoveries  are not yet known. Our most thrilling stories  are not yet told.  Our grandest journeys

It's 11 pounds and can deliver packages within a six mile radius of its home base, in this case Walmart and the Dallas area. You may not have this in your area just yet, but for people living in the Dallas area or in Christiansburg, Virginia, it is totally normal to see a drone deliver a package in your neighborhood. Here's how it works. The drones sit here on their charging pads in their nest waiting for an order. Once someone places an order in the Wing Delivery app, the order is packed in this tote. The dread will take off from its pad and let down this yellow clip which an employee will use to attach the tote. This was incredible incred fun to do by the way. I had to go through training to do this. And finally the drone will deliver the package within 30 minutes or less from the time of ordering. So you might think, wow, an invention for incredibly lazy people. Yeah, maybe. But consider this. You're in the middle of a science experiment and you'forgotten one ingredient. Or maybe you need ice cream or snacks for a movie. Or maybe for one reason or another, physically going to the store is a little bit hard for you and you just needed a couple things. Drone delivery is useful in all of these cases and it benefits the rest of us by removing vehicles from the road that would normally be delivering these items. After all, you shouldn't need a two ton vehicle to deliver a two ounce bottle of medicine. Right now it is totally free to customers. So what do you think? Would you use the service?

It's slightly. Or it's not hot? Mmm, this is good chocolate milk. Mmm still cold. So the company that did that delivery is called Flytrac and they do drone delivery is in only four locations.
So as soon as I found out, I drove an hour and a half to get here. The process for ordering is actually pretty simple. They have an app, you download, you select your location, choose your food and they deliver it straight to you. The only problem was that all of the delivery times are at least 30 minutes and I had to wait 40 minutes for this cookie.

owned by Google's parent company, Alphabet. The global drone delivery industry is experiencing quite a massive boom as of late. In 2022, global deliveries jumped 80 % and projections for last year are moving in the same direction. But it's not totally clear if the business model as a whole is viable in the long term for delivering things like juice, coffee and sandwiches.
It's a different argument for medical delivery though, which provides life-saving support every day in many countries across Africa. Australian operator Swoop Aero has been delivering medical items across Africa for years now. And last year they established a medical delivery network in regional Queensland, which is particularly helpful for regional Australians living pretty far away from pharmacies.  Whether or not you actually like the idea of drone delivery or not,
The reality is this technology is consistently getting regulatory approval globally,  expanding to new locations and reaching more and more people every single day. Like here in Queensland where

Ranked Choice Voting @march_on_harrisburg",2022-10-27 20:21:08,PA Elections Worker Filling Out Ballots,"okay part 3 my name is Marin
I'm a progressive voter in Pennsylvania
and I'm walking you through my ballot as I fill it out
I did all the research so you don't have to
this is the 3rd part
I did 2 other videos
one on the governor's race and one on the Senate race
and now I'm gonna do my local elections in Pittsburgh
okay so first up for the US House of Representatives
uh district 17
we have Chris Deluzio versus Jeremy Shaffer
Chris Deluzio aka Connor Lamb in a different font is the Democratic candidate for Congress
I'm like not kidding
Chris Deluzio also has a pretty standard democratic platform
uh supports all the basic things
abortion access
he's pretty pro labor pro union
so I will be voting for Chris
and I don't have any ranking options because there are just 2 candidates
his competitor is Republican Jeremy Shaffer
which these men all look the same
I promise we have people that are not white men with brown hair in District 17
Jeremy Schafer is very anti communist China
anti critical race theory blah blah
okay not gonna vote for him
next up we have the state Senate election for the 42nd district
the only candidate running is Democrat Wayne Fontana
who in my opinion is a walking embodiment of why we need term limits
he's just a regular old rank and file
been there forever democrat
so I guess I'll vote for him
but I would love for someone to primary him please
next up we have the 27th district for the state House
we have Democrat Dan Deasy
another person that I would love to be primaried
uh been in there for a long time
like 15 years now
I mean he does support abortion rights
thinks minimum wage
should be increased
like all good things
he's kinda weak on environmental stuff
so again healthy democracy
has challengers
okay dan deasy’s challenger
is this guy in the middle
Ed Brosky um
he does not talk to any media outlets
he has like barely anything
he's got like 3 campaign things
it's like some more support
small businesses
and the PA Liquor Board
and I don't know
it was just we're just not going to
he's a Republican
we're not going to vote for him
okay last one is the Home Rule Charter Amendment
basically in Allegheny County
our council has to resign before they're allowed to run for another office
but it is only a part time position
it's the only elected office in PA that has this rule
and if you resign
then instead of having a special election
the other council members appoint a new one
which I don't like
and I think this is silly
so I'm gonna vote yes to repeal it
and my trusted and sources have confirmed that yes to repeal is the way to go
thank you all

Follow us on YouTube 👇",2022-11-02 23:23:53,PA Elections Worker Filling Out Ballots,"This is a TikTok for people in Pennsylvania. If you're not from Pennsylvania, you can still watch it, but this isn't for you. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled yesterday that any mail in ballots that are incorrectly dated or do not have a date written on the envelope will not be counted. Even if they are submitted by or on election Day. They will not be counted if they do not have the correct date written on the envelope. Why? Wait, actually, why? I mean, it makes no sense. If they're still receiving the ballots by election Day, then they know that the ballots came in on time regardless of what the date on the envelope says. And it's not like a fake date can change a vote. I mean, everyone still gets one vote. It's just people who accidentally get their dates wrong don't get their vote counted. And how do they tell if a date is incorrect? I mean, if they're counting all the votes at the same time, then how would they be able to tell if a vote came in one day earlier versus one day later? I mean, maybe they separate the ballots based on what day they were received or what day they were submitted. But if that's the case, then isn't the date sort of unnecessary because they already know which day the ballot was received? Sorry, I got carried away there. Let's just look at the rules. Like, what constitutes an incorrect date? I do not know. I looked thoroughly on the official voting website for Pennsylvania. All it said was that you have to sign and date the declaration on your envelope. That's all the guidance they give you. So I'm assuming it means the day that you fill out your ballot. But what if you decide to submit your ballot the day after you fill it out, which is what I did. Does that mean you have to write a different date? And what if you write your dates the European way, where the day is first and the month is second? I'm advising you to please write it the American way, just in case your vote doesn't get counted otherwise. But this just seems like a weird way to throw out a lot of votes from people who are just as confused as me. So, please, if you live in Pennsylvania, write the date that you fill out your ballot very carefully. Make sure to get it correct based on the next to zero guidance that the state of Pennsylvania has given you. Because I want your vote to count. And maybe next time around, this won't be so confusing.","['tiktok', 'people', 'pennsylvania', 'youre', 'pennsylvania', 'still', 'watch', 'isnt', 'pennsylvania', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruled', 'yesterday', 'mail', 'ballots', 'incorrectly', 'dated', 'date', 'written', 'envelope', 'counted', 'even', 'submitted', 'election', 'day', 'counted', 'correct', 'date', 'written', 'envelope', 'wait', 'actually', 'mean', 'makes', 'sense', 'theyre', 'still', 'receiving', 'ballots', 'election', 'day', 'know', 'ballots', 'came', 'time', 'regardless', 'date', 'envelope', 'says', 'like', 'fake', 'date', 'change', 'vote', 'mean', 'everyone', 'still', 'gets', 'one', 'vote', 'people', 'accidentally', 'get', 'dates', 'wrong', 'dont', 'get', 'vote', 'counted', 'tell', 'date', 'incorrect', 'mean', 'theyre', 'counting', 'votes', 'time', 'would', 'able', 'tell', 'vote', 'came', 'one', 'day', 'earlier', 'versus', 'one', 'day', 'later', 'mean', 'maybe', 'separate', 'ballots', 'based', 'day', 'received', 'day', 'submitted', 'thats', 'case', 'isnt', 'date', 'sort', 'unnecessary', 'already', 'know', 'day', 'ballot', 'received', 'sorry', 'got', 'carried', 'away', 'lets', 'look', 'rules', 'like', 'constitutes', 'incorrect', 'date', 'know', 'looked', 'thoroughly', 'official', 'voting', 'website', 'pennsylvania', 'said', 'sign', 'date', 'declaration', 'envelope', 'thats', 'guidance', 'give', 'im', 'assuming', 'means', 'day', 'fill', 'ballot', 'decide', 'submit', 'ballot', 'day', 'fill', 'mean', 'write', 'different', 'date', 'write', 'dates', 'european', 'way', 'day', 'first', 'month', 'second', 'im', 'advising', 'please', 'write', 'american', 'way', 'case', 'vote', 'doesnt', 'get', 'counted', 'otherwise', 'seems', 'like', 'weird', 'way', 'throw', 'lot', 'votes', 'people', 'confused', 'please', 'live', 'pennsylvania', 'write', 'date', 'fill', 'ballot', 'carefully', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'correct', 'based', 'next', 'zero', 'guidance', 'state', 'pennsylvania', 'given', 'want', 'vote', 'count', 'maybe', 'next', 'time', 'around', 'wont', 'confusing']",0,real,0.4880207072767907

However, there has been a growing section of the population that believes the disgraced billionaire is still alive. And now, disturbing footage that supports this theory has surfaced on the internet and may soon go viral. So, is Epstein really alive?

and gave viewers a glimpse of what the island was like. In one of the videos, there were two men on golf carts, and one of them had grey hair and had a striking resemblance to Epstein, but was it really him, and why did people have doubts about his death? Well, there have been rumors that he was a Mossad intelligence agent and that he was being used to compromise high profile people in Hollywood and in the US government, as well as gather intelligence for the Israeli intelligence. So, was Epstein really compromising Hollywood elites and politicians? Turns out, Epstein did reveal this during what would be one of his

❤️I Wish You All, Many Of Blessings❤️",2022-12-16 01:42:19,Jeffrey Epstein Spotted 'Alive and Well' in New Mexico,"The video shows a clip of a TV news and with a caption of “Even JE’s own brother doesn’t believe it”, “Epstein is still alive and was saved by global elites”, “Don’t let this die. This is real” and the news anchor is saying “I also talked to Jeffrey Epstein‘s brother who gave me exclusive insight and tells me that he thinks the evidence shows that Jeffrey did not kill himself. In July Jeffrey Epstein was found semiconscious with marks in his neck in his jail cell from an apparent suicide attempt. The attorney for his cellmate requested a video from outside the cell to prove that his client saved Epstein‘s life. Last month metropolitan correctional center officials said they couldn’t find it. A day later they announced they did have it. But now federal prosecutors say the video no longer exist and the MCC quote inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier. I spoke with the cellmate’s attorney from New York.” A man on the phone is speaki ng and saying “The various inconsistent accounts of what happened to the video are deeply troubling. We are gonna request that court conduct a hearing with live testimony to determine exactly what took place.” Then the news anchored continued “Bruce Barquette isn’t the only one troubled. So is Epstein‘s brother Mark here’s why Epstein’s jail cell looked like this when the medical examiner arrived hours after his death August 10th. Bedsheets strewn around to fashion the denises with complicated knots. Epstein was dead, but EMTs inexplicably moved his body before investigators arrived and Mark Epstein tells me what he sees in these photos doesn’t add up to suicide by hanging saying “all we know is the guards said he cut him down when he found him if you look at the noose the long end of the noose has a hammed edge and it wasn’t cut no creases.” Mark Epstein says this news doesn’t show any cut marks so how could’ve been part of a bedsheet Epstein used to hang himself. There is a piece of orange bedsheet looped through a hole on the bottom bunk not tied on not able to hold Epstein’s weight according to his brother. Mark says his brother was upbeat before his death because he was about to have a bond hearing telling me “at first I thought ok, maybe he didn’t want to go through this, decided to take himself out, was facing life in jail. But then I started seeing and learning what was going on. No, nobody thought he was going to kill himself. Jeffrey wasn’t a wimp. I knew him better than anybody, we were brothers.” What about the fact that Epstein changed his will two days before he died.

With all the recent news about the Epstein list, sources have revealed of a possible sighting of a mysterious figure who some believe might be Jeffrey Epstein.  Officially,  Epstein died in jail in 2019,  but the circumstances were fishy, right?  Have you heard about the dead man's switch theory?  Well, Epstein's passport showed travel logs after his reported death, private islands, escape routes.
People claim to have seen him post-mortem, grainy photos, questionable sources, but just enough to spark curiosity.  Some believe Epstein had connections to influential figures who'd help him vanish.  A web of secrecy.  I'm not saying it's true,  but it's a wild theory. What are your thoughts?  Drop a comment.

The strategy here is that they want to be able to invade Taiwan. They're worried that the United States will project military power from bases in Hawaii and the continental United States to Asia to defend Taiwan. And so what China is trying to do is to do these cyber intrusions,  lay in wait,  and at the right moment, attack ports, attack water supply, attack  energy supplies  to prevent the United States from projecting military power forward.
So in short, they're  preparing for war. Why do you think we're getting this story now?  I think part of the reason is that the administration, the US government, has had a hard time  getting these private companies to take the necessary security measures. These companies, small utilities, aren't directly controlled by the US government. They're small private companies.  And so the Department of Homeland Security has tried to get them to increase their cybersecurity standards.
has tried to get them even just to disclose that they have  an issue  but often they don't want to do that they don't want to announce to their customers that they have a problem  and they don't want to spend the extra money that would be required for cyber security

China's cyber army is invading critical U.S. services, an attempt to break into the system behind Texas's independent power grid. Other victims include a water utility in Hawaii, a West Coast port, and at least one oil and gas pipeline, according to that report you're seeing there.  Brendan Wells, executive director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity Agency, told The Washington Post this, quote,  it is very clear that Chinese attempts to compromise critical infrastructure
are part to pre-position themselves to be able to disrupt or destroy that critical infrastructure in the event of a conflict, to either prevent the United States from being able to project power into Asia, or to cause societal chaos inside the United States to affect our decision making  around a crisis.

So you're not supposed to just put it in this way, but you're actually supposed to flip it. So we're gonna take the bag and we're gonna put it around the lip of this like that. And then you're gonna push in. I'm gonna push it in this way. And you can see the seam is now on the inside.
I actually like this way better because it doesn't create that weird like suction. Like I feel like the suction is gone when you put it inside out like that.

This is shot from a DJI Mavic 3 drone at 3.58 p.m. local time in Pottersville, California on December 17th, 2023. It was uploaded three hours ago to YouTube on December 18th. So therefore we know that this isn't CGI because  this weather matches  Pottersville, California.  And this would have certainly taken more  than 24 hours to create.  Which is not even 24 hours yet.  But anyway,  um,  not a balloon.  Not any, uh,  any craft I've ever seen or known that  has any sort of capability. I doubt the military would be flying something so secretive over a area like this where it could be seen by other people. It's out in the open, so Chinese perhaps, but watch when he zooms in on this thing. And it's even trying to, seems like it's trying to evade the camera.When that's the best.","['oh', 'look', 'lets', 'go', 'back', 'beginning', 'shot', 'dji', 'mavic', '3', 'drone', '358', 'pm', 'local', 'time', 'pottersville', 'california', 'december', '17th', '2023', 'uploaded', 'three', 'hours', 'ago', 'youtube', 'december', '18th', 'therefore', 'know', 'isnt', 'cgi', 'weather', 'matches', 'pottersville', 'california', 'would', 'certainly', 'taken', '24', 'hours', 'create', 'even', '24', 'hours', 'yet', 'anyway', 'um', 'balloon', 'uh', 'craft', 'ive', 'ever', 'seen', 'known', 'sort', 'capability', 'doubt', 'military', 'would', 'flying', 'something', 'secretive', 'area', 'like', 'could', 'seen', 'people', 'open', 'chinese', 'perhaps', 'watch', 'zooms', 'thing', 'even', 'trying', 'seems', 'like', 'trying', 'evade', 'camerawhen', 'thats', 'best']",1,fake,0.5590868365400204

For the voice, Ledger's goal was to create a tone that didn't echo the work Jack Nicholson did in his 1989 performance as the Joker.

Capobaras are also popular as domesticated pets in some parts of the world. Capobaras are excellent swimmers and are often found in or near water. In fact, they are semi-aquatic animals, which means that they spend a significant amount of time in water to keep cool, to escape predators and to find food. Capobaras have webbed feet and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes. They are also able to swim quickly and easily, making them well adapted to their semi-aquatic lifestyle.

I am not hoarding tampons.  And just to prove it, here are all the tampons  I have left.
Uh, oh and people got really upset about the prospect of me doing a tampon partnership. I mean, it made the news.  And then the tampon brands, they got real quiet. Um, and that's okay. Today, I'm gonna go hand out all of these extra tampons I have left so that no one can call me a tampon hoarder.  Just filling up my goose purse, don't mind me. And just a reminder that people of all genders use tampons, not just women.  The goose purse is filled with tampons, let's go hand some out, shall we? Okay.
I'm at the mall with see if anybody needs a tampon.  Just a trans girl giving out some tampons. Trampons!  Hi, would you want any tampons? I'm just giving them out. Oh, sure. Oh, cool! Have some.

or we can choose to limit government and lower inflation. We can choose political indoctrination or we can choose classical education. These choices are symptoms of the underlying struggle to ensure that constitutional government can endure and that Western civilization can survive. And we launched this campaign to bring accountability to government, regain sovereignty at our border and restore sanity to our society. We cannot succeed as a country if we allow our nation to be invaded.
Our currency to be debased, our cities to crumble, and our kids to be indoctrinated. The DC elites who facilitated this mess do not care about you, and they do not work for you. They work for themselves. They seek to accumulate power at your expense to pursue an agenda that is harmful to the American people. Citizens do not serve politicians. It is the duty of politicians to serve you. Talk is cheap.  Actions speak louder than words.
Reversing the decline of this nation requires leadership that delivers big results for the people we are elected to serve. I have a record of leading with conviction, championing an agenda marked by bold colors, delivering on my promises, and defeating the people who are responsible for our nation's decline. That is the type of leadership we need for all of America. Now, over the past many months, Casey and I have traveled across the country to deliver a message of hope that decline is a choice and that we can, in fact,
succeed again as a nation. Nobody worked harder and we left it all out on the field. Now, following our second place finish in Iowa, we've prayed and deliberated on the way forward. If there was anything I could do to produce a favorable outcome, more campaign stops, more interviews, I would do it. But I can't ask our supporters to volunteer their time and donate their resources if we don't have a clear path to victory. Accordingly, I am today suspending my campaign. I'm proud to have delivered on 100 % of my promises.
and I will not stop now. It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance. They watch his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him. While I've had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear.

One of them, Ron DeSantis, is getting a major boost as Iowa's governor makes a rare endorsement. 

Both spoke with Dasha Burns. Tonight, Governor Kim Reynolds explaining why she's breaking with the Iowa tradition of staying neutral and endorsing Ron DeSantis. I just felt like I couldn't sit on the sidelines any longer. 

We have too much at stake. I truly believe that he is the right person to get this country back on track. It's arguably the biggest endorsement of the primary and a much-needed win for the DeSantis campaign, which has invested significant time and resources here. 

This one's obviously very meaningful because Kim has proven to be a great leader that Iowans love. With two months to go, former President Trump maintains a dominant 27-point lead among likely Iowa caucus goers, with DeSantis and Nikki Haley tied for second. 

For those who criticize you and say, why are you endorsing a guy who's been slipping in the polls? Trump is 30 points ahead. What do you say to those critics? I don't base my decision on polls. I take a look at who I believe is the right person for the right job. 

I believe that Ron is the right person for the right job, and I believe he's going to win. Do you worry about the risk that she's taking by endorsing you? No, I don't. I mean, first of all, I respect the fact that that's not her calculation, which is rare amongst elected officials. 

I've had people come to me and say, you know, that they endorsed him because of the threats and everything like that. If you can look in the mirror and say you did what you think is right for the right reasons, then just let the chips fall where they may. 

Mr. Trump was quick to attack Governor Reynolds for her endorsement, calling her America's most unpopular governor. What is your relationship like now with the former president? Well, you know, I assume it's, well, I don't know. 

I really can't tell you. That's probably a question for him. Have you spoken with him recently? No, I haven't. When's the last time? Probably the last time he called to ask if I would endorse him, and I said I wasn't at this point. 

The question now of her endorsement of DeSantis will make a difference. I just hope that'll help persuade some of those voters to take a look at him closer. Does it impact my vote? I don't know for sure at this point. 

He's been on my radar, so I maybe I'll feel like I know a little bit more after the debate. Do you believe Trump can't win? Yeah, I believe he can't win, and I believe Ron can. If DeSantis wants to prove Trump is beatable, he'll have to do it here.

I'm proud to have delivered on 100 % of my promises, and I will not stop now.
It's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance. They watch his presidency get stymied by relentless resistance, and they see Democrats using lawfare this day to attack him. While I've had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent, Joe Biden. That is clear. I signed a pledge to support the Republican nominee, and I will honor that pledge.
He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackage formed of warmed-over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents.

Let's bring in GOP presidential candidate, Governor, Florida Ron DeSantis. Governor, welcome. Thank you. I've heard from people that I trust that your ground game in Iowa is superb. You've been to all 99 counties. Is it possible the polling out there does not reflect the true nature of the race? Well, of course, I think that's been true in every Iowa caucus and recent memory. And the reason is, is because it's difficult to poll. You're talking about a two to three hour process where people go in middle of January, it's going to be cold, it's going to be snowing. And so these are folks that are really committed. We're closing in on 40,000 caucus commitments. And if you think about it, the turnout will probably be be between 160,000 and 200,000 caucus goers total. And we're going to add, we're adding more every day. And most people still haven't made a final decision. So, so we've got the organization, we've got the grassroots, and really our task is to bring this in for a landing over the next five weeks. I can tell you that the interest in this has definitely picked up because we've been here, you know, for many months coming, I think the last month or so, the interest is picking up. And I think people are taking this process very, very seriously. They certainly don't believe a lot of what they hear in some of the national media, that somehow we shouldn't even have a primary. They want to have, they want to have this caucus and they want their voice to be heard. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a fellow candidates suggest you're auditioning for 2028. Let's play it. I'll get you to respond. I don't think Ron DeSantis is interviewing. I don't think he wants to be Trump's vice president. I don't think he's a vice president personality. I think he's interviewing for 2028. How do youond, sir, we don't have till 2028 and now is the time. And that's why I ran, because I see the direction the country'going and that's why I'm running. But he is right. I'm not running for cabinet or any other office. All right, well, look, we've been through these polls so many times as Republicans. I remember 2022 was supposed to be a big red wave. All these polls were showing. Think, though that there are a lot of Democrats that want to take Biden off the ticket. I think ultimately that will be his decision. But now we were on your network a week and a half ago and we debated someone that I think is waiting in the wings, Gavin Newsom. I think Harris is waiting in the wings. I think they have a lot of people waiting in the wings. And the problem for that, for us would just simply be, you know, they're even more left wing than Joe Biden is.","['less', 'six', 'weeks', 'iowa', 'caucuses', 'race', 'gop', 'nominee', 'heating', 'lets', 'bring', 'gop', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'governor', 'florida', 'ron', 'desantis', 'governor', 'welcome', 'thank', 'ive', 'heard', 'people', 'trust', 'ground', 'game', 'iowa', 'superb', 'youve', '99', 'counties', 'possible', 'polling', 'reflect', 'true', 'nature', 'race', 'well', 'course', 'think', 'thats', 'true', 'every', 'iowa', 'caucus', 'recent', 'memory', 'reason', 'difficult', 'poll', 'youre', 'talking', 'two', 'three', 'hour', 'process', 'people', 'go', 'middle', 'january', 'going', 'cold', 'going', 'snowing', 'folks', 'really', 'committed', 'closing', '40000', 'caucus', 'commitments', 'think', 'turnout', 'probably', '160000', '200000', 'caucus', 'goers', 'total', 'going', 'add', 'adding', 'every', 'day', 'people', 'still', 'havent', 'made', 'final', 'decision', 'weve', 'got', 'organization', 'weve', 'got', 'grassroots', 'really', 'task', 'bring', 'landing', 'next', 'five', 'weeks', 'tell', 'interest', 'definitely', 'picked', 'weve', 'know', 'many', 'months', 'coming', 'think', 'last', 'month', 'interest', 'picking', 'think', 'people', 'taking', 'process', 'seriously', 'certainly', 'dont', 'believe', 'lot', 'hear', 'national', 'media', 'somehow', 'shouldnt', 'even', 'primary', 'want', 'want', 'caucus', 'want', 'voice', 'heard', 'former', 'new', 'jersey', 'governor', 'chris', 'christie', 'fellow', 'candidates', 'suggest', 'youre', 'auditioning', '2028', 'lets', 'play', 'ill', 'get', 'respond', 'dont', 'think', 'ron', 'desantis', 'interviewing', 'dont', 'think', 'wants', 'trumps', 'vice', 'president', 'dont', 'think', 'hes', 'vice', 'president', 'personality', 'think', 'hes', 'interviewing', '2028', 'youond', 'sir', 'dont', 'till', '2028', 'time', 'thats', 'ran', 'see', 'direction', 'countrygoing', 'thats', 'im', 'running', 'right', 'im', 'running', 'cabinet', 'office', 'right', 'well', 'look', 'weve', 'polls', 'many', 'times', 'republicans', 'remember', '2022', 'supposed', 'big', 'red', 'wave', 'polls', 'showing', 'think', 'though', 'lot', 'democrats', 'want', 'take', 'biden', 'ticket', 'think', 'ultimately', 'decision', 'network', 'week', 'half', 'ago', 'debated', 'someone', 'think', 'waiting', 'wings', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'think', 'harris', 'waiting', 'wings', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'waiting', 'wings', 'problem', 'us', 'would', 'simply', 'know', 'theyre', 'even', 'left', 'wing', 'joe', 'biden']",0,real,0.3359001450434088

Not connecting with the voter, whether that be personality. Donald Trump says it's about loyalty. Francis Suarez says it's about your relationships. 

And it's not about those individuals so much. I'm curious the analysis of Ron DeSantis of why not yet is connecting. Well, I think, did you just see the news today about the record fundraising haul we've had? 

Nobody's been able to match that in the history of modern presidential politics. Okay, a few things. Now, to be fair to Ron DeSantis, it's an impossible question posed by Fox News fill-in host last night, who has had his own troubles connecting in the past. 

There's no good way for any politician to answer, like, what's wrong with you? Why don't people like you? And yet it's a consistent genre of campaign questions. But that really is not the kind of question a candidate at this point campaign for being weeks after launching his in for president. 

The governor made her being the right wing. In the Santa gay law, Japanese health care in the state of Florida and banning abortion after six weeks and shipping migrants out of the state, possibly in what some believe was a criminal scheme, DeSantis has positioned himself as the hardest core member of the MAGA army. 

And while that may get him Eric Tymon Fox, and in fact it has, I don't think it's broadly popular among the general population, general electorate. But also, there's a precedent here he should think of, because others have tried this exact same model before and it failed spectacularly.

Now we’re starting to put ATLAS to work and think about how the robot should be able to perceive and manipulate objects in its environment while maintaining that characteristic high-level of performance that we expect from Atlas. Carefully considering the forces that exist between the robot and the object and how that might or might not tip the robot over for example is really important to success. It’s already hard for a robot to know where it is so when we’re trying to manipulate something  like a plank, we have to just make pretty educated guesses about. Where is the plank? How fast is it moving? How do we need to move the arms to cause the plank to spin 180° very quickly and if we get those estimates wrong, we end up doing silly things and falling over. We can explore all those questions in the simulator and then we can test them on the real Hardware and often those test in the real world will result in a broken robot, which is fine. We can fix it, but if we want to push the boundaries, we can do that in SIM first.","['video', 'shows', 'man', 'explaining', 'boston', 'dynamics', 'atlas', 'robot', 'saying', 'thinking', 'make', 'robot', 'move', 'dynamically', 'environment', 'like', 'parkour', 'dance', 'starting', 'put', 'atlas', 'work', 'think', 'robot', 'able', 'perceive', 'manipulate', 'objects', 'environment', 'maintaining', 'characteristic', 'highlevel', 'performance', 'expect', 'atlas', 'carefully', 'considering', 'forces', 'exist', 'robot', 'object', 'might', 'might', 'tip', 'robot', 'example', 'really', 'important', 'success', 'already', 'hard', 'robot', 'know', 'trying', 'manipulate', 'something', 'like', 'plank', 'make', 'pretty', 'educated', 'guesses', 'plank', 'fast', 'moving', 'need', 'move', 'arms', 'cause', 'plank', 'spin', '180', 'quickly', 'get', 'estimates', 'wrong', 'end', 'silly', 'things', 'falling', 'explore', 'questions', 'simulator', 'test', 'real', 'hardware', 'often', 'test', 'real', 'world', 'result', 'broken', 'robot', 'fine', 'fix', 'want', 'push', 'boundaries', 'sim', 'first']",0,real,0.49521530461185126

And so let's clear the air on all of this stuff that's going around about MRNA technology in our livestock. So please note that currently there are no MRNA vaccines used in the beef cattle industry. The technology has been around, but right now on the market, there's only killed or modified live vaccines used in beef cattle. What's more, all of our livestock vaccines are licensed by the usda following rigorous testing. There's no vaccines in our meat. And rest assured that producers work very closely with a veterinarian to create an animal health protocol that prevents disease and builds immunity in their livestock. Now, already there are labeled beef companies that are marketing their beef as MRNA free, which is disingenuous at best, and it's preying on people's fears and emotions at worst.

And he left everything to his two secret black” , “Mother and I have spent the last 26 years in complete and crippling shame and it is still a drop in the bucket of the immeasurable amount of pain I have caused each of you. My wife learned of your arrival, Misha, and demanded that I cut you off completely. I tried to reason with her, but she threatened to expose my infidelity and my illegitimate children. And I was such a coward.
I'm a coward even now for making this video instead of making the effort to meet you.
I am ashamed and disappointed with myself. I didn't know how to stand to my truth and stand up to my wife. I did, however, manage to stand up for you, John and Misha.
While Joan kept me away from you with a threat of exposure, she did not keep me from providing for you. You see, I told her that if I had to accept a life without you, she would not get a red cent of my fortune. And that you would be named equally in my will in the event of my passing. But with everything going on in the world right now, I realize that I have to go a step further. Jordan. Megan. I leave our home here in New York, in New Orleans. To you. To you.
To do with whatever you want. The rest of my estate, my properties in Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, my bank accounts, investment portfolios, all liquid and intangible assets, everything, all of it will go to my children, John and Misha. Girls, all your life I've been telling you to make your millions. And I hope you have. If not, you can always sell the house and split the profit. But my entire estate, my entire estate belongs to John and Misha. And it is up to them to do with it what they will. It is truly the least I can do as I and this country have failed you. And hopefully one day America will do what's right as well. That's it. Brad.” , “My father.?” , “What a prick.” , “Um.

I just want to remind all you real estate investors around the world, like Laaina is not for sale. Please don't reach out to these families and take advantage of them during the most devastating times of our lives. If I don't make it through this, I love everybody. In recent days, Oprah Winfrey has been facing a series of significant developments that hint at a hidden narrative unfolding beneath the surface. Adding to these revelations, Tom Hanks has stepped forward to shed light on Oprah's genuine motivations and the undisclosed agenda behind the Maui fires. The information is quite astonishing, so prepare yourself as we delve into the details in the following video. The human impact and the economic toll of the Maui fires continues to unfold. The state estimates losing $11 million a day. Speculation has arisen about a potential connection between Tom Hanks and Oprah Winfrey in regards to questionable activities transpiring in Maui. As the residents of Maui wake up to yet another day of devastation caused by the devastating wildfire which has tragically claimed lives and displaced hundreds of people, there is a growing curiosity about the wealthiest landowners on the island and their conspicuous silence in the midst of this crisis. However, Tom Hanks recent statements are clarifying that he has never been involved with Oprah in any such heinous activities. Instead, he has come forward to reveal her intentions concerning the land in Maui. I looked at that debris, I looked at all those brught cars. I can I smell what I'm smelling? You know, I think we want to make sure that we do this. As the Devastating flames engulfed a five square mile area, claiming at least 106 lives, some voices on the Internet have ventured into the realm of the Bizaarre. They suggest that influential figures, including Winfrey, who owns valuable property on the island, might have somehow orchestrated the inferno to further their mysterious agendas. Several TikTok users have raised suspicions, pointing fingers at billionaires like Winfrey. They allege that the fires are part of a supposed plot to obtain valuable land in Maui from indigenous communities. This conspiracy theory has arisen due to the belief that the celebrity acquired a substantial 2,000 acre parcel on the island in March 2023. After 2017, Oprah continued expanding her land in Monteissieto to over 70 acres, including buying a A4 land. Moreover, some powerful figures rumored association with Maui's properties has led to a dramatic surge in property prices.","['see', 'entire', 'families', 'whove', 'lost', 'every', 'single', 'thing', 'theyre', 'living', 'air', 'mattress', 'cot', 'chair', 'want', 'remind', 'real', 'estate', 'investors', 'around', 'world', 'like', 'laaina', 'sale', 'please', 'dont', 'reach', 'families', 'take', 'advantage', 'devastating', 'times', 'lives', 'dont', 'make', 'love', 'everybody', 'recent', 'days', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'facing', 'series', 'significant', 'developments', 'hint', 'hidden', 'narrative', 'unfolding', 'beneath', 'surface', 'adding', 'revelations', 'tom', 'hanks', 'stepped', 'forward', 'shed', 'light', 'oprahs', 'genuine', 'motivations', 'undisclosed', 'agenda', 'behind', 'maui', 'fires', 'information', 'quite', 'astonishing', 'prepare', 'delve', 'details', 'following', 'video', 'human', 'impact', 'economic', 'toll', 'maui', 'fires', 'continues', 'unfold', 'state', 'estimates', 'losing', '11', 'million', 'day', 'speculation', 'arisen', 'potential', 'connection', 'tom', 'hanks', 'oprah', 'winfrey', 'regards', 'questionable', 'activities', 'transpiring', 'maui', 'residents', 'maui', 'wake', 'yet', 'another', 'day', 'devastation', 'caused', 'devastating', 'wildfire', 'tragically', 'claimed', 'lives', 'displaced', 'hundreds', 'people', 'growing', 'curiosity', 'wealthiest', 'landowners', 'island', 'conspicuous', 'silence', 'midst', 'crisis', 'however', 'tom', 'hanks', 'recent', 'statements', 'clarifying', 'never', 'involved', 'oprah', 'heinous', 'activities', 'instead', 'come', 'forward', 'reveal', 'intentions', 'concerning', 'land', 'maui', 'looked', 'debris', 'looked', 'brught', 'cars', 'smell', 'im', 'smelling', 'know', 'think', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'devastating', 'flames', 'engulfed', 'five', 'square', 'mile', 'area', 'claiming', 'least', '106', 'lives', 'voices', 'internet', 'ventured', 'realm', 'bizaarre', 'suggest', 'influential', 'figures', 'including', 'winfrey', 'owns', 'valuable', 'property', 'island', 'might', 'somehow', 'orchestrated', 'inferno', 'mysterious', 'agendas', 'several', 'tiktok', 'users', 'raised', 'suspicions', 'pointing', 'fingers', 'billionaires', 'like', 'winfrey', 'allege', 'fires', 'part', 'supposed', 'plot', 'obtain', 'valuable', 'land', 'maui', 'indigenous', 'communities', 'conspiracy', 'theory', 'arisen', 'due', 'belief', 'celebrity', 'acquired', 'substantial', '2000', 'acre', 'parcel', 'island', 'march', '2023', '2017', 'oprah', 'continued', 'expanding', 'land', 'monteissieto', '70', 'acres', 'including', 'buying', 'a4', 'land', 'moreover', 'powerful', 'figures', 'rumored', 'association', 'mauis', 'properties', 'led', 'dramatic', 'surge', 'property', 'prices']",1,fake,0.7018940503414728

He claimed that the entire occasion had been tarnished by Will's outbursts. A lot of people worked really hard to get to that place and to have their moment in the sun to get their award for the really hard work they did. The Ace Ventura star told King. It is no mean feat to go through all the stuff you have to go through when you're nominated for an Oscar. It's a gauntlet of devotion that you have to do. It was just a selfish moment that cast a pall over the whole thing. The Academy of Motion. Picture Arts and Sciences indicated they would be looking into the incident after the ceremony concluded. The Academy condemns the actions of Mr. Smith at last night's show. The organization said in a statement to Variety on Monday. We have officially started a formal review around the incident and we'll explore further action and consequences in accordance with their bylaws, standards of conduct, and California law. The actor should have been arrested for punching Chris Rock at the Oscars, but Jim Carrey is being called out for hypocrisy for saying. Tweets have shown a video of Carey from June 1997 while he was accepting an award at the MTV Movie Awards. After accepting his prize for the Cable Guy, Kerry appears on stage and gives a forceful kiss to Alicia Silverstone on the lips, much to Silverstone's discomfort. At the time, Silverstone was only 20 while Cary was over 35. The actor has been called a hypocrite for his remarks about the event involving Smith and his behavior in the videos has also been criticized. The video has been shared. Thousands of times on Twitter since it was uploaded, albeit it should be noted that the majority of these tweets incorrectly state Silverstone's age. Apparently he went backstage to apologize to a humiliated Silverstone. One Twitter user wrote, Jim Carrey says, Will Smith should have been arrested for hitting Chris Rock. How about when Jim Carrey forcibly kissed Alicia Silverstone when he was going up on stage to accept an award? Imagine being Jim Carrey sickened by a slap while also being the same Jim Carrey who forcefully kissed Alicia. Silverstone tweeted another user. It had literally no impact on his career whatsoever. One of the actor's critics stated with another adding, look at her reaction after he did it. She looks so disgusted. Even more actors than Carrie have been caught kissing award presenters without their will. After winning Best Actor for The Pianist in 2003, Adrien Brody stunned Hall Berry by kissing her. She told Andy Cohen in 2017 that her first reaction was that of extreme shock and disgust. Smith's slapping a rock quickly. became the most talked about event from this year's Oscars ceremony, leading to significant criticism of his behavior from many Hollywood peers. Despite the incident, Smith received a standing ovation after he accepted the award for Best Actor for his portrayal of King Richard, and afterward broke down in tears while accepting the award after Rock made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's bald head, referring to her as GI Jane, numerous celebrities, including this one weighed in on the situation. Pinkett Smith has been very candid about.","['actors', 'apologies', 'reaffirmed', 'difficulty', 'nominated', 'oscar', 'claimed', 'entire', 'occasion', 'tarnished', 'wills', 'outbursts', 'lot', 'people', 'worked', 'really', 'hard', 'get', 'place', 'moment', 'sun', 'get', 'award', 'really', 'hard', 'work', 'ace', 'ventura', 'star', 'told', 'king', 'mean', 'feat', 'go', 'stuff', 'go', 'youre', 'nominated', 'oscar', 'gauntlet', 'devotion', 'selfish', 'moment', 'cast', 'pall', 'whole', 'thing', 'academy', 'motion', 'picture', 'arts', 'sciences', 'indicated', 'would', 'looking', 'incident', 'ceremony', 'concluded', 'academy', 'condemns', 'actions', 'mr', 'smith', 'last', 'nights', 'show', 'organization', 'said', 'statement', 'variety', 'monday', 'officially', 'started', 'formal', 'review', 'around', 'incident', 'well', 'explore', 'action', 'consequences', 'accordance', 'bylaws', 'standards', 'conduct', 'california', 'law', 'actor', 'arrested', 'punching', 'chris', 'rock', 'oscars', 'jim', 'carrey', 'called', 'hypocrisy', 'saying', 'tweets', 'shown', 'video', 'carey', 'june', '1997', 'accepting', 'award', 'mtv', 'movie', 'awards', 'accepting', 'prize', 'cable', 'guy', 'kerry', 'appears', 'stage', 'gives', 'forceful', 'kiss', 'alicia', 'silverstone', 'lips', 'much', 'silverstones', 'discomfort', 'time', 'silverstone', '20', 'cary', '35', 'actor', 'called', 'hypocrite', 'remarks', 'event', 'involving', 'smith', 'behavior', 'videos', 'also', 'criticized', 'video', 'shared', 'thousands', 'times', 'twitter', 'since', 'uploaded', 'albeit', 'noted', 'majority', 'tweets', 'incorrectly', 'state', 'silverstones', 'age', 'apparently', 'went', 'backstage', 'apologize', 'humiliated', 'silverstone', 'one', 'twitter', 'user', 'wrote', 'jim', 'carrey', 'says', 'smith', 'arrested', 'hitting', 'chris', 'rock', 'jim', 'carrey', 'forcibly', 'kissed', 'alicia', 'silverstone', 'going', 'stage', 'accept', 'award', 'imagine', 'jim', 'carrey', 'sickened', 'slap', 'also', 'jim', 'carrey', 'forcefully', 'kissed', 'alicia', 'silverstone', 'tweeted', 'another', 'user', 'literally', 'impact', 'career', 'whatsoever', 'one', 'actors', 'critics', 'stated', 'another', 'adding', 'look', 'reaction', 'looks', 'disgusted', 'even', 'actors', 'carrie', 'caught', 'kissing', 'award', 'presenters', 'without', 'winning', 'best', 'actor', 'pianist', '2003', 'adrien', 'brody', 'stunned', 'hall', 'berry', 'kissing', 'told', 'andy', 'cohen', '2017', 'first', 'reaction', 'extreme', 'shock', 'disgust', 'smiths', 'slapping', 'rock', 'quickly', 'became', 'talked', 'event', 'years', 'oscars', 'ceremony', 'leading', 'significant', 'criticism', 'behavior', 'many', 'hollywood', 'peers', 'despite', 'incident', 'smith', 'received', 'standing', 'ovation', 'accepted', 'award', 'best', 'actor', 'portrayal', 'king', 'richard', 'afterward', 'broke', 'tears', 'accepting', 'award', 'rock', 'made', 'joke', 'jada', 'pinkett', 'smiths', 'bald', 'head', 'referring', 'gi', 'jane', 'numerous', 'celebrities', 'including', 'one', 'weighed', 'situation', 'pinkett', 'smith', 'candid']",1,fake,0.6759084412590184

CNN's Jeremy Diamond is gathering new details.  He's been picking up some new reporting. Jeremy, bring us up to speed here.
Well, first of all, Kate, think it's important to note that the aid situation, the humanitarian situation in northern Gaza is just so, so desperate. And that seems to be part of what led to this scene. Hundreds, if not thousands of people  surrounding some of these  aid trucks that were able to enter northern Gaza, some of the  very few aid trucks that have actually been able to make it in there. And you can see in this video by the Israeli from the Israeli military,  the crowds of people around these trucks. But what appears to have happened is that the Israeli military opened fire on some of these people who are surrounding.
these trucks.  An Israeli military official telling us that the crowd approached the forces  in a manner that posed a threat to the troops and they say that those troops then responded with live fire. Now eyewitnesses on the scene have told us that Israeli tanks as well as drones opened fire on this crowd  and that following that there was a chaotic scene.  Some of the drivers of these A trucks apparently  tried to get away  amid  this gunfire  and killed several additional people.  We were told that 104
people were killed in this incident. 760 people injured according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.

I'm just gonna start with a couple of bones I have to pick with you. Number one, in 2007 you cast me as Monty in Daddy's Little Girls. Idris mentioned that Tyler Perry's production was changing the way men, especially black men, were being portrayed in the media. Because of that role, it changed not only my career,
but it also changed the way I believe that people cast black men.  In support of Idris's observation, a close associate of Perry claimed that Perry's production  had a tendency to emasculate black men due to the fact that he himself might be gay.  made it clear that he said, look, no one can know that I'm gay.

It's cities underneath there. And they're actually creating these tunnels even under civilian locations, under hospitals, under schools, which makes it even more dangerous.

The army says that in the past 24 hours, dozens of terrorists were killed in clashes in and around Khan Yunis, where Hamas leadership is hiding in underground tunnels and bunkers.  Over 100 targets were hit in and around the city, including weapons caches and terror tunnels.  Among those killed, the grandson of Hamas founder, Sheikh Yassin.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the cabinet that Israel is not yet ready to wind down its war against Hamas  even as international pressure mounts for a shift by Israel  to lower intensity fighting to avoid civilian casualties.
In the north, Hezbollah rocket fire has damaged the Mount Maron air traffic control base near the Lebanese border.  The army confirmed that the site's radar domes were hit by missiles on Saturday, but the facility is now working on backup systems.  Hezbollah fired a barrage of more than 40 rockets and several missiles at the base atop Mount Maron,  which is located some 8 kilometers from the Lebanon border.  Hezbollah said the attack was a response to the alleged Israeli killing of Hamas terror chief
Salih al-Aruri in Lebanon last week.  The IDF is investigating the incident in order to prevent similar attacks on the sensitive base.  In response, the IDF said it carried out several waves of strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon,  including two significant military compounds belonging to the terror group.  IDF Chief of Staff Halevi said that the military was exacting increasingly heavy prices on Hezbollah as it continued to carry out attacks on northern Israel.
U.S. Secretary of State Blinken is due to arrive in Israel this evening on his fifth visit to the country since the start of the war on October 7th.  Blinken will arrive after talks in Qatar, where its prime minister said that the killing of Hamas deputy commander Al-Aurore in Beirut last week has affected Doha's ability to mediate between the terror group and Israel over the release of hostages and ceasefire efforts. But the Gulf state's political leader said that Qatar will continue its efforts.
He also said that hostilities along the Red Sea shipping route are unacceptable  and an unfortunate effect of the war in Gaza.  Blinken warned that the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza could metastasize and threaten security in the wider Middle East.  This is a moment of profound tension in the region that could lead to even more insecurity and even more suffering, Blinken said.
