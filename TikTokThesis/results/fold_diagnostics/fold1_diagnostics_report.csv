The park doesn’t have still water which is an ideal environment for mosquitoes to lay eggs and the water is also filled with fish that eat mosquito larva. And as mosquitoes are deterred by the scent of garlic, the garlic spray is sprayed twice a day all over Disneyland.

Let's talk about those. A paper cup by nature should absorb water. If it's not absorbing water, then that means there must be a barrier in between the paper and the liquid. 

And that barrier is polyethylene plastic. A study found that in 15 minutes of contact with hot liquids, leach 25,000 microplastic particles into your cup. But no one's questioning this. No one's really thinking about it because it's just part of our daily lives. 

Are we very good at metabolizing plastics? No, plastic is a foreign body. It's a foreign particle. In fact, it'll break down into nanoplastics. And nanoparticles in general have the issue of being able to penetrate cell membranes. 

So it can penetrate very deeply into the cell. It can cause inflammation. Your body doesn't know how to deal with it. It's a foreign object. So you'll get the inflammatory response when you encounter these. 

But to make things worse, the microplastics themselves are a foreign body, but they also release plasticizer chemicals when they're in contact with your body, and they can also carry toxic chemicals into your body. 

The fact that they can basically invade and integrate into our cells and you are what you eat, are we turning into real life Barbie and Candels? We could be because there's actually microplastics that have been detected in human lung, blood, and placenta. 

And who knows how much of this is getting into babies? Are babies being born with plastic in their bodies? I would guesstimate yes, just based on the evidence.

Rosie didn't hold back one bit as she took a stroll down the memory lane of her tumultuous time on the iconic show the View. Taking a stroll down memory lane, Rosie harked back to her entry into the daytime Talk show in 2006. She didn't hesitate to hint that the show's dynamics weren't exactly harmonious. She didnt name names, but subtly indicated that Elizabeth Hasselbeck was a prominent player in the melodrama. Moreover, she hinted at a mysterious figure pulling the strings, referring to the show being less about womens voices and more about the directives of a certain white male CIS producer, the late Bill Getty. But the real juicy bits were reserved for her interactions with the current host, Whoopi Goldberg. Rosie's narrative took a turn as she revealed her initial exit was a result of her clashes with Hasselbeck. But upon her return, it was Whoopi who emerged as the thorn in her side. These clashes weren't just everyday disagreements, they revolved around some pretty dark and controversial topics. I have a black kid. I raise wy. I have a kid in my house that is not. You don't have to be black to know what racism is. Yes you do. No you don't. Yes you do. You do not. Anyway, delving into the specifics of their disputes, Rosie dropped a bombshell. Apparently, Rosie and Whoopi's worlds collided over the SA case involving you know who. But that wasn't the only shocker Rosie spilled that the View seemingly turned a blind eye to significant matters like the Rory Kennedy documentary about Abu Ghraib and the alleged US torture and even the SA allegations. Rosie was taken aback when Whoopi flat out refused to discuss these matters on air while the world watched the legal battle unfold. The drama reached its pinnacle in 2007 when ABC decided to part ways with Rosie, effectively ending her contract. However, this incident wasnt the first time Rosie had aired her grievances against Whoopi. She made waves in 2020 when she chatted with Howard Stern, revealing that their relationship had been rocky from the very start. Rosie humorously recounted an incident involving a commercial break signal that Whoopi supposedly missed, leading to tension right from day one.","['listen', 'white', 'lady', 'telling', 'racist', 'jay', 'american', 'whos', 'homophobia', 'hatred', 'looks', 'like', 'dont', 'think', 'itracist', 'somebody', 'turns', 'leader', 'free', 'country', 'says', 'park', 'car', 'know', 'racist', 'think', 'racism', 'dont', 'know', 'black', 'kid', 'rage', 'b', 'kid', 'house', 'dont', 'black', 'know', 'racism', 'yes', 'dont', 'yes', 'around', 'folks', 'ro', 'donll', 'spilled', 'major', 'tea', 'jaw', 'dropping', 'appearance', 'brookshields', 'podcast', 'thought', 'daytime', 'talk', 'shows', 'camaraderie', 'discussions', 'think', 'rosie', 'didnt', 'hold', 'back', 'one', 'bit', 'took', 'stroll', 'memory', 'lane', 'tumultuous', 'time', 'iconic', 'show', 'view', 'taking', 'stroll', 'memory', 'lane', 'rosie', 'harked', 'back', 'entry', 'daytime', 'talk', 'show', '2006', 'didnt', 'hesitate', 'hint', 'shows', 'dynamics', 'werent', 'exactly', 'harmonious', 'didnt', 'name', 'names', 'subtly', 'indicated', 'elizabeth', 'hasselbeck', 'prominent', 'player', 'melodrama', 'moreover', 'hinted', 'mysterious', 'figure', 'pulling', 'strings', 'referring', 'show', 'less', 'womens', 'voices', 'directives', 'certain', 'white', 'male', 'cis', 'producer', 'late', 'bill', 'getty', 'real', 'juicy', 'bits', 'reserved', 'interactions', 'current', 'host', 'whoopi', 'goldberg', 'rosies', 'narrative', 'took', 'turn', 'revealed', 'initial', 'exit', 'result', 'clashes', 'hasselbeck', 'upon', 'return', 'whoopi', 'emerged', 'thorn', 'side', 'clashes', 'werent', 'everyday', 'disagreements', 'revolved', 'around', 'pretty', 'dark', 'controversial', 'topics', 'black', 'kid', 'raise', 'wy', 'kid', 'house', 'dont', 'black', 'know', 'racism', 'yes', 'dont', 'yes', 'anyway', 'delving', 'specifics', 'disputes', 'rosie', 'dropped', 'bombshell', 'apparently', 'rosie', 'whoopis', 'worlds', 'collided', 'sa', 'case', 'involving', 'know', 'wasnt', 'shocker', 'rosie', 'spilled', 'view', 'seemingly', 'turned', 'blind', 'eye', 'significant', 'matters', 'like', 'rory', 'kennedy', 'documentary', 'abu', 'ghraib', 'alleged', 'us', 'torture', 'even', 'sa', 'allegations', 'rosie', 'taken', 'aback', 'whoopi', 'flat', 'refused', 'discuss', 'matters', 'air', 'world', 'watched', 'legal', 'battle', 'unfold', 'drama', 'reached', 'pinnacle', '2007', 'abc', 'decided', 'part', 'ways', 'rosie', 'effectively', 'ending', 'contract', 'however', 'incident', 'wasnt', 'first', 'time', 'rosie', 'aired', 'grievances', 'whoopi', 'made', 'waves', '2020', 'chatted', 'howard', 'stern', 'revealing', 'relationship', 'rocky', 'start', 'rosie', 'humorously', 'recounted', 'incident', 'involving', 'commercial', 'break', 'signal', 'whoopi', 'supposedly', 'missed', 'leading', 'tension', 'right', 'day', 'one']",2708,0.02080032441402797,84728.7341211226

There had actually been a news article on celebrities painting their houses a weird shade of blue and now the public is speculating that they must have planned everything ahead of time. While others are questioning the fires over land, others are claiming that the elites wanted something more than just land. They wanted something that they could not get without the fire.
and that is the children. This conspiracists are alleging that since most of the people who have yet to be found in the fires are children, those children might have been taken. In a deeply concerning development, the Hawaii State Department of Education has reported that 2,025 students remain unaccounted for in the Lahaina public school system following the devastating fire on August 8th in Lahaina, Maui. This has made the public question why some kids were at school while others were home.
But it seems that the fire coincided with the first day back at school for many students. Schools had been closed due to an outage, leaving many children home alone. The tragedy has ignited a firestorm of criticism directed at Hawaii's state government, particularly Governor Josh Green, for perceived inadequacies in emergency response and preparedness. The absence of warning sirens and a perceived lack of an official response to the disaster have drawn widespread condemnation.
While the cause of the fires hasn't been determined, Hawaiian Electric, the major power company on Maui, is under scrutiny for not shutting down power lines when high winds created dangerous fire conditions. Hawaiian Electric previously said both the company and the state are conducting investigations into what happened. Meanwhile, the conspiracy theories have become so widespread that Hawaiian officials have addressed them with the office of Governor Josh Green saying in a statement,
There is no truth to the horrendous assertion that the fires were deliberately set to raise the historic town of Lahaina,  which was the first capital of the Hawaiian kingdom.  But who knows, there has to be some truth they could tell instead of trying to keep everything secret.  A fan on Twitter said, Oprah's land in upcountry near Kula has a huge underground facility with tones of concrete. She has been building it for years.  Tom Hanks is reported to own a home in Maui also.
along with Steven Tyler, Lars Ulrich, and Woody Harrelson. Or it's just a coincidence. Another said, Everyone including Tom Hanks, who had their Maui house painted blue, was in on this hit job. They knew it was coming. They had foreknowledge, which is a big issue in illegal action. So what's your take on Tom Hanks and his role in the Maui fires? Tell us in the comment section.

I felt like Hollywood is just spineless,  en masse.  it uh just,  it really felt like, oh, this is  a really clear indication that we're not the cool club anymore. Jim Carrey, like everyone else watching the 2022 Oscars, witnessed Will Smith slap Chris Rock and was not pleased with what transpired next. He had a lot of harsh words for the man that shocked the world at the Oscars, and some will definitely leave you surprised. The 60-year-old actor from Liar Liar remarked, Smith went on to accept the Best Actor Oscar for his role in King Richard after getting into a confrontation with the 53-year-old rapper and the 57-year-old Saturday Night Live star. All of the people at the Dolby Theatre on March 27th, when the Philadelphia native won, came up to cheer him, as Carey mentioned. In 2002 and 2007, Smith was nominated for a golden globe award for best actor but ultimately did not win. They asked Chris, do you want to file charges and Chris apparently said no, he did not. He doesn't want the hassle. I had announced this morning that was suing Will for $200 million because that been arrested,  but Rock did not seek charges against Smith after the incident. It's hard not to see Carey's point in the clip,  even if suing for that amount might be slightly excessive. The Canadian native went on to say that it's okay to yell from the audience if you don't approve of a joke.  But you do not have the right to walk up on stage and smack somebody in the face because they said words. King argued that the incident escalated to that level, but Carey disagreed. It didn't escalate.  He said it came out of nowhere because Will has something going on inside him that's frustrated. I wish him the best. I really do. I don't have anything against Will Smith. He's done great things, but that was not a good moment. It cast a pall over everybody's shining moment. Other actors agreed. Watch the show. I'm sure you saw the moment everyone is talking about between Chris and Will.  Your thoughts. I don't condone violence. just don't see any reason for it.","['sickened', 'sickened', 'standing', 'ovation', 'felt', 'like', 'hollywood', 'spineless', 'en', 'masse', 'uh', 'really', 'felt', 'like', 'oh', 'really', 'clear', 'indication', 'cool', 'club', 'anymore', 'jim', 'carrey', 'like', 'everyone', 'else', 'watching', '2022', 'oscars', 'witnessed', 'smith', 'slap', 'chris', 'rock', 'pleased', 'transpired', 'next', 'lot', 'harsh', 'words', 'man', 'shocked', 'world', 'oscars', 'definitely', 'leave', 'surprised', '60yearold', 'actor', 'liar', 'liar', 'remarked', 'smith', 'went', 'accept', 'best', 'actor', 'oscar', 'role', 'king', 'richard', 'getting', 'confrontation', '53yearold', 'rapper', '57yearold', 'saturday', 'night', 'live', 'star', 'people', 'dolby', 'theatre', 'march', '27th', 'philadelphia', 'native', 'came', 'cheer', 'carey', 'mentioned', '2002', '2007', 'smith', 'nominated', 'golden', 'globe', 'award', 'best', 'actor', 'ultimately', 'win', 'asked', 'chris', 'want', 'file', 'charges', 'chris', 'apparently', 'said', 'doesnt', 'want', 'hassle', 'announced', 'morning', 'suing', '200', 'million', 'arrested', 'rock', 'seek', 'charges', 'smith', 'incident', 'hard', 'see', 'careys', 'point', 'clip', 'even', 'suing', 'amount', 'might', 'slightly', 'excessive', 'canadian', 'native', 'went', 'say', 'okay', 'yell', 'audience', 'dont', 'approve', 'joke', 'right', 'walk', 'stage', 'smack', 'somebody', 'face', 'said', 'words', 'king', 'argued', 'incident', 'escalated', 'level', 'carey', 'disagreed', 'didnt', 'escalate', 'said', 'came', 'nowhere', 'something', 'going', 'inside', 'thats', 'frustrated', 'wish', 'best', 'really', 'dont', 'anything', 'smith', 'hes', 'done', 'great', 'things', 'good', 'moment', 'cast', 'pall', 'everybodys', 'shining', 'moment', 'actors', 'agreed', 'watch', 'show', 'im', 'sure', 'saw', 'moment', 'everyone', 'talking', 'chris', 'thoughts', 'dont', 'condone', 'violence', 'dont', 'see', 'reason']",1887,0.02401015870561855,85979.33492315846

It closed at five o'clock today. But first of all, if you notice, this is upstairs that you would have to take a ballot. So if you're an elderly person or a disabled person, you're going to have to take the elevator or whatever because you can't drop off anyone's ballot but your own these days here in Georgia. That's been changed. But I'm going to to you why these rules changed and why it affects us here in Fair County. The way the election boards work, the the Party, the points one person, Republican Party points one person and then the Fair County Commission, they get to appoint the person, the next person. So there's three people. Well, the commission is controlled by four Republicans. So they're the ones who changed the rules from the last election to where now we can only vote Monday through Friday, nine to five and two Saturdays. They also did away with Sunday vote. Another day that we couldn't vote, which is actually usually minorities vote heavily on those Sundays. She's in with struggles to polls. You know, when it comes down to people saying, oh, they're not really suppressing the vote, this is a perfect example. The biggest thing that comes to me is convenience of voting. Let's make it available for everybody. No matter what time of the day it is, you'll be able to vote with an absentee ballot. You'll be able to go ahead and because I'm going to tell you if you want to mail it through the federal postal system, you never know what might happen. So I'm just going to tell you if you can't vote early, make sure that you take that absentee ballot directly to that box up there and it's got to be before five o'clock any day and it can't be after the fourth of November.","['theres', 'election', 'office', 'closed', 'five', 'oclock', 'today', 'first', 'notice', 'upstairs', 'would', 'take', 'ballot', 'youre', 'elderly', 'person', 'disabled', 'person', 'youre', 'going', 'take', 'elevator', 'whatever', 'cant', 'drop', 'anyones', 'ballot', 'days', 'georgia', 'thats', 'changed', 'im', 'going', 'rules', 'changed', 'affects', 'us', 'fair', 'county', 'way', 'election', 'boards', 'work', 'party', 'points', 'one', 'person', 'republican', 'party', 'points', 'one', 'person', 'fair', 'county', 'commission', 'get', 'appoint', 'person', 'next', 'person', 'theres', 'three', 'people', 'well', 'commission', 'controlled', 'four', 'republicans', 'theyre', 'ones', 'changed', 'rules', 'last', 'election', 'vote', 'monday', 'friday', 'nine', 'five', 'two', 'saturdays', 'also', 'away', 'sunday', 'vote', 'another', 'day', 'couldnt', 'vote', 'actually', 'usually', 'minorities', 'vote', 'heavily', 'sundays', 'shes', 'struggles', 'polls', 'know', 'comes', 'people', 'saying', 'oh', 'theyre', 'really', 'suppressing', 'vote', 'perfect', 'example', 'biggest', 'thing', 'comes', 'convenience', 'voting', 'lets', 'make', 'available', 'everybody', 'matter', 'time', 'day', 'youll', 'able', 'vote', 'absentee', 'ballot', 'youll', 'able', 'go', 'ahead', 'im', 'going', 'tell', 'want', 'mail', 'federal', 'postal', 'system', 'never', 'know', 'might', 'happen', 'im', 'going', 'tell', 'cant', 'vote', 'early', 'make', 'sure', 'take', 'absentee', 'ballot', 'directly', 'box', 'got', 'five', 'oclock', 'day', 'cant', 'fourth', 'november']",1543,0.027934442068663898,86785.06351263772

A huge force of soldiers, allies working together for a common goal, and a decisive military blow struck against a common enemy. But most of all, this prophecy refers to a surprise. So I have prophecies on the blog where I've seen airborne invasion and so many soldiers parachuting down from the sky.

I've seen submarines coming up, you know, and soldiers storming the beaches, literally coming out of the sea as well. And the understanding that the Lord has given me actually clear.

So obviously there's rides where there's moving water, but they also have fountains everywhere. So that water at Disneyland is never still. And finally, the results are in from this epic study where they genetically modified mosquitoes so that the offspring of these genetically modified mosquitoes,  all the females would die and the male mosquitoes would carry the genetically modified gene to the next generation to again, kill all the female offspring that have genetically modified male babies, et cetera. They did this study in Florida and they found that also the spread of these genetically modified mosquitoes only went about 400 meters. So it's not like it took over and like we had no more mosquitoes anymore, which I know we all know is gonna end the world. Also, did you know that the main animal that mosquitoes want to bite is us?

But wait. It gets even juicier. Brace yourselves for the big reveal. The Peoples Fund of Maui, it turns out, is owned and operated by the Entertainment Industry Foundation. EIF, a non-profit organization with close ties to, you guessed it, the entertainment industry. That's right folks.
The charity we all thought was going to help the needy citizens of Maui is actually in bed with the Hollywood elite. Once this bombshell was dropped, the rumor mill went into overdrive and questions about transparency and ethics started flooding in. But here's where it gets really scandalous. The fat cat executives over at EIF seem to be living the high life, while the rest of us are left wondering where the alleged $10 million went. In fact, some people are convinced that the donations made to the Peoples Fund of Maui might not even get to the intended recipients. You see, reports came crashing down revealing that the president of EIF is raking in a hefty salary north of $400,000 a year. The CEO isn't far behind, pocketing over $300,000 annually. And lets not forget the CFO casually stashing away more than $290,000 each year.
Not to mention the 29 other individuals on EIFS payroll who are laughing all the way to the bank. With salaries exceeding $100,000 each year, these 13 top tier executives are collectively rolling in a mind boggling $3.2 million while the lower level workers, the ones actually doing the charity's heavy lifting, are left to scrape by on an average of approximately $64,527 per year.
Now if that doesn't make you shake your head in disbelief, I don't know what will.
The glaring disconnect between EIFs lavish executive salaries and the paltry $1,200 being doled out to those in need through the Peoples Fund of Maui is enough to make anyone's blood boil. It'no wonder the public has begun to wonder whether Duane and Oprah's supposed act of charity was nothing more than a slick publicity stunt designed to keep them in the spotlight.
Critics argue that the real winners in this scheme are the executives running EIF while the victims of the Hawaii wildfire are left high and dry. As the scandal continues to unfold, it prompted a broader conversation about the true nature of non profit organizations, especially those with executives living the high life on donors' hard earned cash. Are these organizations genuinely committed to supporting those in need or are they just elaborate schemes to further line the pockets of the rich and famous? In the midst of this growing controversy, some outspoken advocates are encouraging individuals to sidestep the shady dealings of celebrity backed nonprofits and donate directly to those in need through independent platforms.
After all, by cutting out the middleman, you can ensure your donations land where they belong without any detours through the bank accounts of celebrity endorsed charities.
In any case, Oprah and Duane both…”

out of nowhere just ruled that former President Trump will be blocked from appearing on the state ballot because he violated the 14th amendment. This makes Illinois the third state to block Trump from their ballot after both Colorado and Maine did the same thing tonight. In the 72 page ruling, a Cook County judge ordered the Illinois Board of elections must remove Trump from the ballot ahead of the state primary that's happening in just about three weeks and says any vote for Trump will be suppressed because he's not qualified to even be on the ballot. But the Republican delegates, just for the record, in the state will still be free to vote for Trump as a Republican Party nominee at the GOP convention this summer regardless of this ruling. This whole case comes after a group of voters in Illinois objected to Trump's canency because they say he engaged in insurrection in January. Illinois State Election Board ruled that they didn't have the authority to remove Trump, so the petitioners took their complaint to court. There was a hearing a few weeks ago and then this ruling randomly came down tonight. Now the judge did stay or pause her own ruling until this Friday to give Trump time to appeal, but even that may not stop him from being kicked off of Illinois primary ballot on March 19th. There are only two ways really at this point that Trump's name can stay on that ballot. 1. If Trump is successful in the next three weeks to appeal this ruling and have either the Illinois Appeals Court or Illinois Supreme Court issue an emergency stay or pause on this ruling, or two, if the US Supreme Court finally issues their ruling and decides that Colorado Supreme Court was wrong to remove Trump from that state ballot, and in theory that ruling would then also apply to Illinois, Trump's legal team says they will quickly appeal this decision.”

Initially, Malaysian investigators didn't dismiss the notion of deliberate diversion of the aircraft's course, while debris including some confirmed and suspected pieces from the plane
surface along Africa's coast and Indian Ocean Island. In 2018, Malaysia enlisted Ocean Infinity to explore the southern Indian Ocean with a pledge of up to $70 million for locating the aircraft. Prior to this, Malaysia, China, and Australia terminated a fruitless two-year $200 million Australian underwater search in January 2017. Anthony Loeck mentioned that the US seabed exploration company Ocean Infinity
has been approached to discuss the latest search plan following two unsuccessful efforts. He added that Malaysia intends to engage with Australia regarding collaboration for resuming the search once Ocean Infinity's proposal receives approval from Malaysia's cabinet. On March 8, 2014, flight MH370 of Boeing 777 with 227 passengers and 12 crew members on board disappeared while flying from Kuala Lumpur
to Beijing.  This year marks its 10th anniversary of aircraft's disappearance.

Follow us on YouTube 👇",2022-11-02 23:23:53,PA Elections Worker Filling Out Ballots,"This is a TikTok for people in Pennsylvania. If you're not from Pennsylvania, you can still watch it, but this isn't for you. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled yesterday that any mail in ballots that are incorrectly dated or do not have a date written on the envelope will not be counted. Even if they are submitted by or on election Day. They will not be counted if they do not have the correct date written on the envelope. Why? Wait, actually, why? I mean, it makes no sense. If they're still receiving the ballots by election Day, then they know that the ballots came in on time regardless of what the date on the envelope says. And it's not like a fake date can change a vote. I mean, everyone still gets one vote. It's just people who accidentally get their dates wrong don't get their vote counted. And how do they tell if a date is incorrect? I mean, if they're counting all the votes at the same time, then how would they be able to tell if a vote came in one day earlier versus one day later? I mean, maybe they separate the ballots based on what day they were received or what day they were submitted. But if that's the case, then isn't the date sort of unnecessary because they already know which day the ballot was received? Sorry, I got carried away there. Let's just look at the rules. Like, what constitutes an incorrect date? I do not know. I looked thoroughly on the official voting website for Pennsylvania. All it said was that you have to sign and date the declaration on your envelope. That's all the guidance they give you. So I'm assuming it means the day that you fill out your ballot. But what if you decide to submit your ballot the day after you fill it out, which is what I did. Does that mean you have to write a different date? And what if you write your dates the European way, where the day is first and the month is second? I'm advising you to please write it the American way, just in case your vote doesn't get counted otherwise. But this just seems like a weird way to throw out a lot of votes from people who are just as confused as me. So, please, if you live in Pennsylvania, write the date that you fill out your ballot very carefully. Make sure to get it correct based on the next to zero guidance that the state of Pennsylvania has given you. Because I want your vote to count. And maybe next time around, this won't be so confusing.","['tiktok', 'people', 'pennsylvania', 'youre', 'pennsylvania', 'still', 'watch', 'isnt', 'pennsylvania', 'supreme', 'court', 'ruled', 'yesterday', 'mail', 'ballots', 'incorrectly', 'dated', 'date', 'written', 'envelope', 'counted', 'even', 'submitted', 'election', 'day', 'counted', 'correct', 'date', 'written', 'envelope', 'wait', 'actually', 'mean', 'makes', 'sense', 'theyre', 'still', 'receiving', 'ballots', 'election', 'day', 'know', 'ballots', 'came', 'time', 'regardless', 'date', 'envelope', 'says', 'like', 'fake', 'date', 'change', 'vote', 'mean', 'everyone', 'still', 'gets', 'one', 'vote', 'people', 'accidentally', 'get', 'dates', 'wrong', 'dont', 'get', 'vote', 'counted', 'tell', 'date', 'incorrect', 'mean', 'theyre', 'counting', 'votes', 'time', 'would', 'able', 'tell', 'vote', 'came', 'one', 'day', 'earlier', 'versus', 'one', 'day', 'later', 'mean', 'maybe', 'separate', 'ballots', 'based', 'day', 'received', 'day', 'submitted', 'thats', 'case', 'isnt', 'date', 'sort', 'unnecessary', 'already', 'know', 'day', 'ballot', 'received', 'sorry', 'got', 'carried', 'away', 'lets', 'look', 'rules', 'like', 'constitutes', 'incorrect', 'date', 'know', 'looked', 'thoroughly', 'official', 'voting', 'website', 'pennsylvania', 'said', 'sign', 'date', 'declaration', 'envelope', 'thats', 'guidance', 'give', 'im', 'assuming', 'means', 'day', 'fill', 'ballot', 'decide', 'submit', 'ballot', 'day', 'fill', 'mean', 'write', 'different', 'date', 'write', 'dates', 'european', 'way', 'day', 'first', 'month', 'second', 'im', 'advising', 'please', 'write', 'american', 'way', 'case', 'vote', 'doesnt', 'get', 'counted', 'otherwise', 'seems', 'like', 'weird', 'way', 'throw', 'lot', 'votes', 'people', 'confused', 'please', 'live', 'pennsylvania', 'write', 'date', 'fill', 'ballot', 'carefully', 'make', 'sure', 'get', 'correct', 'based', 'next', 'zero', 'guidance', 'state', 'pennsylvania', 'given', 'want', 'vote', 'count', 'maybe', 'next', 'time', 'around', 'wont', 'confusing']",1987,0.022058543327916152,87344.48817312531

Let's bring in GOP presidential candidate, Governor, Florida Ron DeSantis. Governor, welcome. Thank you. I've heard from people that I trust that your ground game in Iowa is superb. You've been to all 99 counties. Is it possible the polling out there does not reflect the true nature of the race? Well, of course, I think that's been true in every Iowa caucus and recent memory. And the reason is, is because it's difficult to poll. You're talking about a two to three hour process where people go in middle of January, it's going to be cold, it's going to be snowing. And so these are folks that are really committed. We're closing in on 40,000 caucus commitments. And if you think about it, the turnout will probably be be between 160,000 and 200,000 caucus goers total. And we're going to add, we're adding more every day. And most people still haven't made a final decision. So, so we've got the organization, we've got the grassroots, and really our task is to bring this in for a landing over the next five weeks. I can tell you that the interest in this has definitely picked up because we've been here, you know, for many months coming, I think the last month or so, the interest is picking up. And I think people are taking this process very, very seriously. They certainly don't believe a lot of what they hear in some of the national media, that somehow we shouldn't even have a primary. They want to have, they want to have this caucus and they want their voice to be heard. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a fellow candidates suggest you're auditioning for 2028. Let's play it. I'll get you to respond. I don't think Ron DeSantis is interviewing. I don't think he wants to be Trump's vice president. I don't think he's a vice president personality. I think he's interviewing for 2028. How do youond, sir, we don't have till 2028 and now is the time. And that's why I ran, because I see the direction the country'going and that's why I'm running. But he is right. I'm not running for cabinet or any other office. All right, well, look, we've been through these polls so many times as Republicans. I remember 2022 was supposed to be a big red wave. All these polls were showing. Think, though that there are a lot of Democrats that want to take Biden off the ticket. I think ultimately that will be his decision. But now we were on your network a week and a half ago and we debated someone that I think is waiting in the wings, Gavin Newsom. I think Harris is waiting in the wings. I think they have a lot of people waiting in the wings. And the problem for that, for us would just simply be, you know, they're even more left wing than Joe Biden is.","['less', 'six', 'weeks', 'iowa', 'caucuses', 'race', 'gop', 'nominee', 'heating', 'lets', 'bring', 'gop', 'presidential', 'candidate', 'governor', 'florida', 'ron', 'desantis', 'governor', 'welcome', 'thank', 'ive', 'heard', 'people', 'trust', 'ground', 'game', 'iowa', 'superb', 'youve', '99', 'counties', 'possible', 'polling', 'reflect', 'true', 'nature', 'race', 'well', 'course', 'think', 'thats', 'true', 'every', 'iowa', 'caucus', 'recent', 'memory', 'reason', 'difficult', 'poll', 'youre', 'talking', 'two', 'three', 'hour', 'process', 'people', 'go', 'middle', 'january', 'going', 'cold', 'going', 'snowing', 'folks', 'really', 'committed', 'closing', '40000', 'caucus', 'commitments', 'think', 'turnout', 'probably', '160000', '200000', 'caucus', 'goers', 'total', 'going', 'add', 'adding', 'every', 'day', 'people', 'still', 'havent', 'made', 'final', 'decision', 'weve', 'got', 'organization', 'weve', 'got', 'grassroots', 'really', 'task', 'bring', 'landing', 'next', 'five', 'weeks', 'tell', 'interest', 'definitely', 'picked', 'weve', 'know', 'many', 'months', 'coming', 'think', 'last', 'month', 'interest', 'picking', 'think', 'people', 'taking', 'process', 'seriously', 'certainly', 'dont', 'believe', 'lot', 'hear', 'national', 'media', 'somehow', 'shouldnt', 'even', 'primary', 'want', 'want', 'caucus', 'want', 'voice', 'heard', 'former', 'new', 'jersey', 'governor', 'chris', 'christie', 'fellow', 'candidates', 'suggest', 'youre', 'auditioning', '2028', 'lets', 'play', 'ill', 'get', 'respond', 'dont', 'think', 'ron', 'desantis', 'interviewing', 'dont', 'think', 'wants', 'trumps', 'vice', 'president', 'dont', 'think', 'hes', 'vice', 'president', 'personality', 'think', 'hes', 'interviewing', '2028', 'youond', 'sir', 'dont', 'till', '2028', 'time', 'thats', 'ran', 'see', 'direction', 'countrygoing', 'thats', 'im', 'running', 'right', 'im', 'running', 'cabinet', 'office', 'right', 'well', 'look', 'weve', 'polls', 'many', 'times', 'republicans', 'remember', '2022', 'supposed', 'big', 'red', 'wave', 'polls', 'showing', 'think', 'though', 'lot', 'democrats', 'want', 'take', 'biden', 'ticket', 'think', 'ultimately', 'decision', 'network', 'week', 'half', 'ago', 'debated', 'someone', 'think', 'waiting', 'wings', 'gavin', 'newsom', 'think', 'harris', 'waiting', 'wings', 'think', 'lot', 'people', 'waiting', 'wings', 'problem', 'us', 'would', 'simply', 'know', 'theyre', 'even', 'left', 'wing', 'joe', 'biden']",2440,0.03574661134975179,85939.17213114754

Now we’re starting to put ATLAS to work and think about how the robot should be able to perceive and manipulate objects in its environment while maintaining that characteristic high-level of performance that we expect from Atlas. Carefully considering the forces that exist between the robot and the object and how that might or might not tip the robot over for example is really important to success. It’s already hard for a robot to know where it is so when we’re trying to manipulate something  like a plank, we have to just make pretty educated guesses about. Where is the plank? How fast is it moving? How do we need to move the arms to cause the plank to spin 180° very quickly and if we get those estimates wrong, we end up doing silly things and falling over. We can explore all those questions in the simulator and then we can test them on the real Hardware and often those test in the real world will result in a broken robot, which is fine. We can fix it, but if we want to push the boundaries, we can do that in SIM first.
